J. Willis (London),13 Jun 2012,4.0,"Let the Great World Spin is a great read, the author manages to tie up all the various threads in each of the storylines without making the novel seem forced or contrived. The characters all carried their own burdens and the life's of the rich, poor and tragic are well drawn without being sentimental. The author does not try to deliberately pull on the readers heart-strings or push some kind of agenda (which given the characters and setting would be very easy to do) but instead lets the lives' and the stories play out and the characters fall where they fall.

Overall while it's not a novel that I would read again, it was very enjoyable and I would read more of this authors work.",1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review
History addict (UK),19 Aug 2011,4.0,This is an interesting book based (very loosely) on an actual event ie a man walking a wire between the twin towers when they were newly built. However the story isn't really about this event but about the people who were affected by it. The cast of characters are very varied and not always expecially appealing. There are some very poignant moments and it does come to a more satisafactory end than I had imagined it might with quite a few twists and unexpected turns along the way. Worth a read but probably not a good holiday read as too thought provoking for that.,0.9285714285714286,objective review,0.9285714285714286,objective review

Cfr07 (Ireland),20 July 2011,3.0,"The books centres around a series of characers and their lives at the time Phillipe Petit did his tightrope walk between the twin towers in 74. I liked the gritty descriptions of NY in the 70's which reminds us it wasn't always the way it is today. I did struggle to understand the point of the piece about Fernando the 13yr old photographer. If this section had been left out if would have made no difference whatsoever, in fact it might have improved things. It was ""well written"" as so many others have described it but parts of the book rambled on for far longer than necessary & I didn't like the ending at all. Overall I enjoyed it but its not a book I would pick up and read again.

"S.

The overall character in the book is, in my view, New York itself and I really enjoyed that part.

carole gillis (Lund Sweden),11 Jan 2011,4.0,"A new version of the old theme of total strangers' lives gradually touching and intertwining, this time set in New York City in 1974.... The descriptions of the tightrope artist dancing blithely on the wire between the twin towers were perhaps the most interesting, letting the reader see not so much the motivation for attempting this amazing feat of daring-do, but his mental preparations, drawing into himself. In fact, McCann lets us look into the lives and thoughts of an array of extreme characters -- a bunch of Black hookers, an Irish semi-saint, a group of grieving mothers and their ways of coping with the loss of their sons in Vietnam -- in an almost always convincing way. I can't really say why I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5--it was a great read, but perhaps because I wasn't totally absorbed into the characters and plot, but more sat on the edge looking in: for example, I could read and understand the terrible grief of the sorrowing mothers but couldn't really feel it.",1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review

The way in which a real historic event combines with everyday lives is remarkably well handled. The story unfolds in a multi-layered, very satisfying way and parallels with future events to add a further dimension. I had to stop reading the chapter about the actual high wire performance as I was on an aeroplane at the time, well above the highest buildings of New York and it all became a little terrifying!

Lucy Talk (London),22 Aug 2010,3.0,"A series of stories about the intertwined lives of New Yorkers, this book captures the essence of the city. The act that knits these lives together is a high wire walk between the twin towers, yet this momentous feat seemed strangely underplayed. A struggling Irish monk who falls in love, a group of grieving mothers, a huddle of New York prostitutes - the characters seemed predictable and one of the book's central themes - of loss and longing - only left a fleeting impression.

I thought the idea of writing about different people and linking them up was very clever and ambitious but somehow it did not work for me as I felt the author had intended.

"Victoria Field ""fal"" (Cornwall UK)",26 Feb 2012,4.0,"This was an amazing book in many ways. At its heart, I think it is a meditation on goodness set against the backdrop of New York. The frame for all the stories is a tight rope walker going between the twin towers. The stories themselves stand independently, then later weave together. Throughout the book, characters have small and large moral dilemmas which they either rise to or fail to do so.

The setting of 1974 seems slightly arbitrary except that it clearly isn't now. The future role of computers is a theme so perhaps it was chosen as the dawn of our cyber-age. It also seems more innocent and the idea of the two Irish brothers going to New York is much more exciting than it would be in our time of hyper-mobility. The character of the priest Corrigan is marvellously drawn and challenges so many ideas of what a life is for. The lives of the sex-workers are fully realised and profoundly sad. Some of the characters, as in life, appear and disappear and it's somehow surprising to see which ones get picked up again in the loose-end tying towards the end of the novel.

The writing is simply superb - it sings from the page and is original and exciting at a sentence level. It also captures the voices of the characters superbly, whether first or third person. I would have given the novel five stars if it weren't just a bit too long. The quick-fire dialogue of the computer hackers, I just skipped, and by the time we had Gloria's back story, I was ready to look forward.

Some of the reviewers here have criticised the artifice of the novel. I think this is part of its beauty, the slight arbitrariness, the unlikely conjunctions of people and events.

I'm still pondering the Tennyson connection - the title and the chapter headings are taken from the poem Locksley Hall - if it comes to me, I'll post again!

I loved the author's note in which he sums up the point of a novel about sad and difficult lives - `Is there any hope that this desolation can bring me solace' - throughout this novel, we find the solace of different kinds of goodness, beauty and connection. I recommend it highly.",1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review
Johnny TimeBomb,24 July 2010,5.0,"I can't recommend this novel highly enough. McCann's prose is near perfect, lyrical and beautiful. He weaves the lives of a dozen or so brilliantly realised characters together using the device of their shared experience of witnessing Philippe Petit's high wire walk between the twin towers of the WTC in 1974. Each character has a distinct and utterly convincing voice and a captavating story or point of view to share. McCann captures a real sense of time and place.

Timothy Clarke,22 July 2010,1.0,"This is a very well written book; and that's where it all ends. The novel consists of a series of short linking stories, but the stories are fairly uninteresting.

Moya Nolan (Ireland),18 May 2010,5.0,"One of the best books I've read in years: engaging storytelling, the strands move this way and that, intertwining and separating again like seaweed in the current, but firmly rooted in the rich back-ground of New York in the 70s.

Dave Kelly,25 Mar 2010,1.0,This is a book of interweaving tales of many people whose lives' seem to change around the instance of Phillipe Petits tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. The book is written in the style of 1974 even though it was written in 2009. Its not a style I like - some of the less pretentious tales are good with likeable/sympathetic characters such as the priest and his hookers but the rich/arty characters turned me off.

"Gerry McCaffrey ""Tir Eoghain"" (Belfast)",31 Oct 2009,3.0,"Despite some exquisite moments there is a nagging sense that something doesn't quite convince. We are introduced to characters like the emotionally brittle and insecure Claire, a Park Avenue resident who has lost her son in Vietnam. Her husband, a judge, veers close to stereotype. An artist called Lara is central to one of the main events of the book, but she feels strangely insubstantial. There are coincidences and strange connections, and at least one credibility-stretching relationship. There is also a surprising lack of real warmth in a novel that seems concerned with the nature of love and family. McCann is perhaps too sensitive when it comes to the mechanics of writing a book, and he moves his characters with all the ruthlessness of a chess master. The book itself appears to be too knowing and aware of its own artifice, and when McCann mentions ""The intrusion of time and history. The collision point of stories"", his motive become clear, and it all becomes very self-conscious.\
\
At one point we're given the almost obligatory mystical vision of a wild animal in an urban landscape. The car crash as an event with narrative repercussions is also a familiar device. When we finally move to the novel's final grand ontological statement, McCann manages the feat of saying something and nothing at the same time. It all feels perilously close to cosy Saturday supplement philosophising, and we're left with a book which is easy to admire, but not so easy to like.\

"Victor Ward ""Victor Ward"" (England)",31 Oct 2009,5.0,"In 1974 Phillipe Petite strung a wire between the Twin Towers and for a couple of hours walked in the air between them. The act reverberated through history as the greatest piece of art history ever conceived and forms the vignette around which this complex novel revolves.

The image of the man on the wire haunts the novel, as the characters talk about him, watch him, try him, and are inspired by him.

Corrigan, a monk, torn between the love of a woman and the love of God. Jazzlyn and Tillie, the mother and daughter hookers, who he allows to use his toilet. Claire and her husband, Solomon, grieving for the death of their son in Vietnam. This is an ensemble piece, built up from a range of people who are all affected, directly or indirectly, by Petite's stunt.

The book is so beautifully written, so pitch perfect, that it is a joy to read. The characters voices, all distinct, but joined by a weariness, express real emotion and despite the inherent sadness of the subject matter are exhilarating.

Although the stories interconnect, often leading one into another or events from one having repercussions in one much later, the story never feels forced or searching for a tidy solution. Only Fernando, the thirteen year photographer seems incongruous and unneccessary, everything else has it's place and purpose.

It was would be easy to call this a 9/11 novel, but whilst the act is present in the future of the Towers, this is a celebration of a willful and artistic piece of terrorism, not a destructive one.

"Steve Keen ""therealus"" (Herts, UK)",1 Feb 2012,4.0,"High above New York City, early morning one day in the 1970s, a wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre supports a death-defying tightrope walker. Down below, in the streets, offices and apartments of the city and beyond, onlookers and others are connected through a network of events, happenstance and mishap.

Two Irish brothers with widely diverse motivations; a mother-and-daughter pair of hookers; a couple of strung out artists; a bevy of California-based proto-geeks; a support group of mothers of the Vietnam dead; a refugee from Guatemala; a judge. We get into heads. We learn secrets. Innermost fears.

Some is told in the first person, some in the third, the focus shifting from direct to indirect reportage.

Mostly the tone is sombre. The only real light moments involve the funambulist himself; thrilling to the danger; anticipating the rush from the altitude, the audience. The event is based upon the real-life stunt carried out by Philippe Petit on 7 August 1974, a performance which left all witnesses awestruck by its audacity: one remarked that he was more like a dancer than a walker, especially when he allowed both feet at times to leave the wire. McCann changes some of the facts, though, so it's not actually Petit himself out on the wire.

Meanwhile, Gloria, one of the bereaved mothers provides a less than positive assessment of the level of solidarity displayed by some of her companions towards their hostess for the day, their snide comments, their gracelessness, their inability to overcome their envy over her lifestyle and her Park Avenue apartment.

Whilst the ""dancer"" provides the central event, Gloria's is maybe the pivotal tale. She provides the key to McCann's thesis: ""everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing as strange as the last, and connected."" Her backstory is one of strength, of triumph over adversity. The granddaughter of slaves, Syracuse graduate, twice divorced. She herself has lost three sons to Vietnam. She attempts to walk home from Park to the Bronx projects, but her feet swell and bleed, and then she is mugged at knifepoint for her handbag, empty save for photos of her dead boys. But at the end of the day she achieves some kind of redemption.

In the aftermath there comes the life-assuring coda, which connects then with now, World Trade Centre with Ground Zero. A reminder that at one time there was nothing sinister in seeing a picture of a plane flying in proximity to the towers. (It also provides a very poignant warning for anyone tempted to displays of levity in the company of US airport security staff.) Unfortunately the coda ultimately stalls, losing the momentum of the rest of the novel.

A shame, because despite its sombre tone, it's mostly worth a read.",0.8688095238095238,objective review,0.8688095238095238,objective review

"J. Coulton ""Julia Coulton"" (Manchester, UK)",11 Sep 2009,5.0,"The theme that runs through this original and spellbinding book in the daring wire walk between the Twin Towers in New York in 1974. But it is about so much more than that. It is an interweaving of lonely characters that leaves a lasting imprint.
Emptiness and loss in very different senses are at the heart of these most moving stories that are very cleverly and seamlessly interlinked. Claudia, a wealthy resident of the well heeled Upper East Side is trying to come to terms with the loss of her son in Vietnam. So desperate that she even tried to pay one of friends to stay with her for a few hours. Corrigan is escaping childhood hurt in Ireland by befriending prostitutes and trying to stay true to his religious order. Tillie, herself a prostitute, imbues her desperate situation with humour:
`I used to love the joke where the last line was: Your Honor, I was armed with nothing more than a piece of fried chicken.'
McCann tells these stories, and many others, in a vivid and deeply compassionate way. He seems to be spinning a web of loss, and even with backgrounds that are not steeped in sadness, it seems he sees trouble ahead. As one of his characters remarks:
`I used to think it was difficult for children of folks who really loved each other, hard to get out from under that skin because sometimes it's just so comfortable you don't want to have to develop your own.'
The New York he brings to life so skillfully is the dangerous 1970's city of violence and malevolence - not the current cleaned up version. This is a book that is haunted by the spectre of both the wire walk, and by the 9/11 tragedy that we know all too well that will come, but that is not referred to here.
But the book is also one of hope, and the wire walk is used to pull all the stories together and lift them out of the depths. Most of the references to it are about other people's reactions to the amazing feat. But in the middle of the book, at its taut centre, McCann explains that:
`The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium.'
And McCann certainly takes the form of novel to new places in this brilliant book. It is sad, beautifully balanced, and very moving. A haunting work indeed.",0.9736842105263158,objective review,0.9736842105263158,objective review
Mary Whipple (New England),19 July 2009,5.0,"Philippe Petit's heart-stopping performance, as he walks between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974, becomes the pivotal event of this magnificent ""New York novel"" in which Colum McCann examines many facets of the city's life. Focusing first on the down-and-outers--prostitutes, the desperately poor, the drug- and alcohol-addicted homeless, the infirm elderly, gang members, casual thieves, and bright young people with no futures--he recreates the lower depths of New York, a place where its citizens every day walk the fine line between survival and death on a completely different tightrope from that of Philippe Petit.

The novel begins with the arrival in the South Bronx of Ciaran Corrigan from Ireland, seeking his younger brother John Andrew, known simply as ""Corrigan"" or ""Corry,"" a monk who has studied in Belgium and who now lives a bare-bones life among addicts and prostitutes in the projects in the South Bronx. Often the brunt of their jokes and sometimes of fists, he provides a way-station for the prostitutes who need a place to stop between tricks. Two of them, Tillie and her daughter Jazzlyn, have good intentions and great street smarts, but they are unable to escape their surroundings, which offer a much-needed quick buck and help them support Jazzlyn's two little girls--and her dangerous drug habit. Ciaran, afraid for the physical and emotional welfare of Corry, tries to persuade him to return home to Ireland, but Corry, in the midst of a spiritual crisis, will not take the easy way out of the ministry he believes he was meant for.

Misery is not limited by economic boundaries here, however, as McCann also shows through other characters, in other parts of the city. The emotional paralysis of Claire Soderberg, a Park Avenue matron, unable to resume her life after the death of her only child in Vietnam, is shared by her support group of four other mothers from all over the city, who have similar devastating losses. An artist from upstate New York, involved in a terrible accident in the city, is overwhelmed by her sense of guilt, and an educated Guatemalan immigrant, who had hoped to finish medical school in the U.S., must let go of her dreams. Each of these people must find some source of enduring beauty, however small, in order to go on. Dense and impressionistic in style, McCann illuminates the lives of many well-developed characters living in various parts of New York City, always doubling back to images of Phillipe Petit on his tightrope, and always showing his characters' overlaps.

Life in general is ""nasty, brutish, and short"" here, with no guarantees that it will ever improve, and as Tillie says of her life, ""I don't know who God is, but if I meet him anytime soon ... I'm going to slap Him stupid."" In the final section of the novel, McCann fast-forwards to 2006, as a character studies an inspirational photo of Philippe Petit walking on his tightrope, with a low-flying plane above him, the plane appearing to be just a few feet from flying into the World Trade Center: ""As if the walking man were somehow anticipating what would come later...[But] the plane passes, the tightrope walker gets to the end of the wire. Things don't fall apart...the man alone against scale, still capable of myth in the face of all other evidence."" In his gorgeous, lyrical descriptions of Philippe Petit's walk, McCann suggests that this walk may be an extraordinary ""gift"" of beauty to a city which, collectively, may have thought it had seen it all. With this novel, however, McCann makes another such gift, an extraordinary homage to New York, with all its flaws, its traumas, its heartbreak--and its moments of great beauty.

He shows us what we are capable of both high and low.

I wanted this to be a knockout as I like the guy, he's a Stoke City fan (pretty sure I read that somewhere) which obviously shows character, and seems a genuine good guy. But too much marmalade for me, not enough bite",0.8333333333333335,objective review,0.8333333333333335,objective review
menapia,22 Sep 2013,1.0,I once resolved never to be influenced by the plaudits of other writers when buying books. On this occasion I succumbed to the blurbs. Big mistake! The author of this book doesn't seem to be able to make up his mind what he wants to write about. The book begins with the famous tightrope walk between the twin towers. (The tightrope walker makes his appearance on several other occasions throughout the book - for the life of me I can't think why) Next we meet two Irish brothers one of whom joins some kind of religious order which has as its aim to aid the hookers and the needy. From there the book grinds tediously on to its unsatisfactory and inconclusive end.,1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review
Ruhy Khoroushi,28 Aug 2013,2.0,"I rate the book as beach read. At the end I felt cheated. I didn't gain any thing by reading it. It may be something more in that book, but I couldn't figure it out, sorry.",0.875,objective review,0.875,objective review

Keith M,29 Sep 2011,4.0,"Having been superficially attracted to this book via the 'Man on Wire' cover (itself a magnificent documentary film), it became clear that the focus of the book was much wider than the high-wire exploits of Monsieur Petit. In fact, I consider this one of the outstanding 'New York novels', along with Paul Auster's sublime New York Trilogy and Don DeLillo's epic Underworld.

McCann develops a number of utterly believable characters (priests, prostitutes, etc) and paints a very convincing picture of modern day New York City, with its attendant tragedy and pathos. A must read.",1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review
Johnc,23 July 2013,5.0,I just loved the style of this book.

Mrs.Patricia A Halliwell,28 Jun 2013,4.0,"The author uses a real escapade, tight rope walking between the Twin Towers as a metaphor and over arching image to tell the story of a disparate group of New Yorkers.

stardropsbymoomlight,11 Jun 2013,5.0,Got off to a clunky start with the conceit of Petit 'walking the line' however quickly picked up as McCann drew me in to his NY characters then linked these disparate lives to a tender conclusion .I love McCann's observation of humanity,1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review

Tizzy (UK),3 Jan 2013,3.0,"I was recommended this book by a friend who raved about it. The story is told through a series of seemingly unconnected people's stories.

Bevan Nicol,21 Nov 2012,5.0,"Let the Great World Spin begins as a book of short stories relating to the events of a day in 1974... only it seems to unravel as a novel where the event itself is the protaganist... fantastic read, thoroughly recommended! oh, and it came on time and in great condition!",0.7222222222222223,objective review,0.7222222222222223,objective review
bibliophile (essex),22 Sep 2011,4.0,"This was a strange read.At times I found it engrossing,moving.heart rending,and a wonderful piece of writing.At times I found it confusing not very clear exactly what was happening,and not very clear about exactly what the connection between the main theme and the sub-plots.
I thought some of the characterisation was very good particularly Tillie and Gloria.It gave a very good perspective on the character of New York,and also the life and tribulations of being a hooker.Perhaps I missed something.but somehow I expected there to be some connections between the story and 9/11.
I would recommend the book as at the end comes together surprisingly well,as I suppose this is a very positive attitude of the book that even in the last 70 odd pages you cannot connceive quite how the story is going to finish.
Good read overall.",1.0,objective review,1.0,objective review
wangfujing (london),31 Aug 2011,5.0,This was the first book I had read by this author and what a discovery. I am now getting through all of his books and have yet to be disappointed . The writing is superb - very insightful and the linking of the stories well paced . Its a story of different lives around a momentous event. Its not suitable for people who maybe have a short attention span or want a lightweight holiday read as it requires attention and engagement. Can recommend to anyone interested in the art of literature.,0.8666666666666668,objective review,0.8666666666666668,objective review

"Mrs. Jane Gordon ""JaGo"" (UK, Merseyside)",20 Aug 2011,1.0,"I had to read this book for book club, but like many of the reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars, I disliked the experience. I did not connect with any of the characters and thought them to be flat and uninteresting. What the book did give me was the desire to read more abvout the tight rope walker - the only interesting person in the whole book!
