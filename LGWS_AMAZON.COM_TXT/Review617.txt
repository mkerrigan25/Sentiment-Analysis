This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Finally a novel that meets all the ridiculous expectations and merits all the awards. McCann is an artist and a craftsman, with an uncanny ability to use language and meter and structure to project intense emotion. He deeply inhabits his broad cast of characters, giving them the not-always-overlapping gifts of life and humanity. He also illuminates New York City from its gritty, mean, harder-to-love past, before Disney and New Urbanism and Giuliani and Sex And the City revitalized it. Push past an opening chapter that feels weaker and less lively than the rest of the story; it is a necessary foundation, if sometimes less deft than the brilliance that follows.
