This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I was intially looking forward to reading this book but it fell short of what I was hoping it would be. I could not figure out what the son in Vietnam and him working on computers had anything to do with it. Am I missing something? I appreciate authors and the work they put into their stories but I just wasn't pleased when I finished the book. May try to read again.
