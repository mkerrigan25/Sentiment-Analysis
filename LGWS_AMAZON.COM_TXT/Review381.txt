 Loved it, not sure why, May 1, 2011

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Hardcover
A friend of mine lent this book to me. While it's not normally the kind of book I would read, I can't describe how much I enjoyed it, and I can't really describe why that is. The story is not amazing. There is not a lot of action. The characters don't blow your mind. What it is, though, is simply great writing. This will sound cliche, but this was the first book I've ever read where I felt like there was not one wasted word.
