This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I had high hopes for this book from the rave reviews, but what I got was a writer trying to prove how clever he was. The result was tedious and I have to say slightly insulting.
I got the parody of Whitman and his lists(I am an English teacher after all) but that understanding wasn't necessary for the novel. But the author wanted me to know just how darned clever he was so he put in 2 callouts to Whitman before rubbing my nose in the 2 pages of lists of "death by..."
However I stopped reading when I got to the chapter about Petit, the tight-rope walker, who was walking on his practice wire in the snow. The simile "It seemed to him that it was like stepping along the spine of a horse toward a cool lake" stopped me in my tracks - what meaningless nonsense! I like original writing but this is absurd.
Maybe the chapters after this one are wonderful. I don't care. I've given up.
