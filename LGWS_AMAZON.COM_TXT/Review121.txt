This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
McCann connects the lives of the novel's well drawn characters to a tightrope walk between the newly constructed World Trade Center towers. He weaves the strands of their seemingly disparate and often desperate stories into a story line that keeps your heading spinning and your emotions gyrating. As awesome and haunting as the feat of human do-and-daring that forms the arc of this riveting, chilling and yet, uplifting book.
