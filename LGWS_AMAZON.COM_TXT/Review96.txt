This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Without falling. As one who sometimes despairs of how the world is going, I loved this brilliant and big-hearted novel, this microcosm of the world. At times, I had to stop reading and literally hold it against my heart. Without sentimentality, McCann let me open up to all the life-force, energy and self-determination of the characters he holds in his loving hands. From a gentle Irish Jesus who tends to a community of boisterous prostitutes, to a group of grieving gold-star mothers, black & white, rich and poor, to judges who just about give up on justice. His characters reach for life any way they can, with a gun in an alley, a spray can on a subway, a saucy stroll for sex, and those who try to control them with a gavel or a gun, good luck. In McCann's N.Y.City, there is despair, joy, death and new life, as thousands, like all of us, seek love, recognition, power and control in a world so seemingly out of control all they can do is spin with it. As bad as it is at times, "ya just gotta love it."
