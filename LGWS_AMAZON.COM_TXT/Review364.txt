Good read about New York City in the 1970s. The descriptive writing of the author makes this book. The 1970s era was a heart wrenching time for many people and a reminder of what the Twin Towers were and the grief brought to America with 9/11. The author hints at historical events during the time of the story, but doesn't bog down the reader.
