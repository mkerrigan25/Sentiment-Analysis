This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
ONE OF THE BEST NOVELS I HAVE EVER READ! THE WAY THE AUTHOR TAKES DIVERSE STORIES OF DIFFERING PEOPLE AND SITUATIONS AND WEAVES THEM TOGETHER, BASED ON A SINGLE SIGHTING OF AN UNUSUAL EVENT, IS MASTERFULL. EACH STORY IS ENGROSSING, AND THE WAY THEY INTERACT IS AMAZING. THE AUTHOR IS A MASTER CRAFTSMAN OF THE NOVEL
