This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Cultural happenings so often grab our attention for a fleeting moment but even in the age of "too much information", we rarely get such an in-depth look at the "whole story". "Let the Great World Spin" is another kind of "whole story"--the tightrope walking incident is a backdrop (although the story is indeed covered well here--I loved reading about the preparation and attention to detail it took to pull it off.) and the fulcrum for many other stories, all connected (albeit very loosely) to that incident.

The writing is great. It's at times funny, poignant, sad, thought-provoking, tragic and uplifting. Some of the characters are so "real" that I felt as if they could be my neighbors, my friends. While the book does have some stories that I felt were "loose threads", even those are well-written and serve a purpose.

The theme of human connectedness is handled very well here. The characters in the story are not only connected by the tightrope incident, they are connected in a "two-degrees of separation" sort of way and it's very interesting to see how the author manages linking people with such seemingly separate and disconnected worlds. In a post-World Trade Center Towers world, this is maybe more relevant and powerful than it could have been in 1974.

I love books like this where I feel immersed in the stories of the characters and yet there still enough plot happening to keep it moving and interesting. Definitely worth reading.
