This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I was looking forward to this book because I love all things New York and am fascinated particularly by the 1970's in NYC. I waited for the paperback to come out but read This Side of Brightness in the meantime to get tuned up on McCann's style. And I guess that is where my discomfort lies - he and I don't have chemistry because of his writing style. I wanted so much to love this book but found it had pacing and character problems. Using Petit's cable walk is both genius and kind of trite ('oh our precarious world'). This is at best a short story as it did not engage me over its length as a novel.
