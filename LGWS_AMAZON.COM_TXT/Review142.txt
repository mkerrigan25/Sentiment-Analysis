I'm a sucker for intertwining stories, so this book was bound to agree with me. Well rounded characters, a little on the sad side. Read it on my kindle and was impressed with the quoted I had pulled out.
Highly impressed with the storytelling and the insights.
On a slightly different note I am so over characters who are good or bad, no in between (I'm talking to you Pillars of the Earth) I think fiction is moving in that direction and this book shows that.
