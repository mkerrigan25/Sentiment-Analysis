This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This is a beautifully written novel woven in a tapestry of human struggles and sensitivity. The author has captured the essence of the many varied spirits, their strengths, and vulnerabilities. I generally don't read fictional books because they tend to depart too far from reality which leaves me feeling very much like there is a far distance between authur and truth. To write a book like this reflects the heart of a writer who has in some way lived the experiences he conveys.
