This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I don't know if the author meant to move us paperback reading masses with this novel. I'm assuming he was; I wasn't moved.

Regardless, I found the almost-plotline interesting and entertaining, the people that populated this novel believable (and more often than not likeable or hateable as if they were real people), and the words that strung the story together well written.

It didn't change my perception of the world, but I enjoyed it all the same.
