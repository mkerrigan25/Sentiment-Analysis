This review is from: Let the Great World Spin PAPERBACK
I'm a Colum McCann fan and have read "The Other Side of Brightness", "Zoli", and "Dancer".

I was eager to read "Let the Great World Spin" and delighted to find the opening chapter following a tightrope walker about to begin his walk. I also enjoy inter-connected stories that shape a whole, such as those written by Amy Tan and Barbara Kingsolver. However, the voices in these novels, while varied, must be absolutely credible or the story drops.

While the chapters told from the elder Corrigan's point of view are extremely effective, other chapters aren't. The most telling example, for me, is Tillie's voice which is not only unconvincing but somehow veers toward stereotype. This essentially reduce the credibility of the character and breaks the tension that is created so effortlessly in other parts of the book.

I should have been with the tight-rope walker on the wire, running into the arms of the police officer. I should have identified all the other tightrope walkers who have wandered in and out of the story and are meant to tie the story into a complete whole. Instead I was left wondering about the gaps that these weaker sections left.

Colum McCann is a gifted and mesmerizing author. I just don't think his authorial magic worked with this book.
