This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
It took me almost half way through the book to start enjoying it and appreciating the author's approach to this novel with interconnected narrative voices. Ultimately a lovely and satisfying read with enough depth and finesse to earn its variety of accolades.
