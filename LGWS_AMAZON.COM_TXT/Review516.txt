This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
than a toddlin' town. Colum McCann's overview and underview of this truly complex city is a journey not to be soon forgotten.
It is about those looking up and those who dare not look down.

A speck on a line...just a break in the horizon between the newly constructed World Trade Center Towers. A man, Philippe Petit, daring to live his dream...daring to literally rise above by walking a tightrope between the towers. But not just walking. Jumping, lying down, running and enjoying the rush of freedom all around him. Will he make it? Will he attain his dream or will the tiny speck plummet to earth...

The on-lookers are those on their own tightrope perhaps one inch from the ground, looking up at him but walking their individual tightrope of dreams to who knows what end.

McCann uses the rope to tie together several individual lives of those looking up. Separate stories but held together by an iron cable swaying in the wind. Sadness, joy, trauma, despair, redemption, justice and injustice all bound together in a literary style far beyond my imagining. His prose flows like a melody, gliding from page to page...sometimes sonorous and sometime jarringly explosive. You become each of his characters in turn; rejoicing at times, suffering at others.

If perhaps, in one of my dreams, I could be both influential and affluent; I would see to it that this 'poetic' prose would find its' way to every young person. It's lessons are softly revealed; it's love and pathos overwhelming, it's tragedy heart-wrenching. Most importantly, it's message revealed as each page is pealed back to reside forever in our memories.

Read it...then read it again...and again ~ it only gets better.
