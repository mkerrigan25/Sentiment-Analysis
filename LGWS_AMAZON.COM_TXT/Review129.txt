McCann writes beautiful prose. With a few staccato brushstrokes, he denotes a New York city scene with such precision that you can see, smell and taste it.

That said, I felt like I needed a bath after I read this book. Death, prostitutes (including a mother-daughter team,) hackers, grieving mothers, all are explored in episodic fashion. There is nothing uplifting about these stories, little to ameliorate the pain that McCann so skillfully evokes.
