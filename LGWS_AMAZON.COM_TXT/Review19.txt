This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Captures NYC amazingly well in the mid 1970s. While I am glad I read this book as chosen by my book club, I can't say it was a page turner for me. I agree with the mixed literary reviews this book received. While it may have been brilliant in parts, whole sections could have eAsily been edited out without any loss to the narrative.
