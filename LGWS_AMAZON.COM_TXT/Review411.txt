This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
A friend who I never knew as an avid reader recommended "Let the Great World Spin" to me. I now should take her recommendations more seriously as I thoroughly enjoyed this book. "Let The Great World Spin" tells a number of tales that all take place on a sweaty New York August Day in 1974. The tales center around the tightrope walker making his famous walk between the two World Trade Center towers. The stories are all individually interesting but their overlap and cleverly thought out touchpoints is what makes this book great. McCann allows you to see from the viewpoint of all the characters and identify with all of their lives. I would definitely recommend this book for the unique style alone and for the way it brilliantly recreates that odd day in 1974 through the eyes of a number of interesting New Yorkers.
