This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
It received a low rating; 1 star would have been "I couldn't finish it". This is a book whose theme is the tenuous relationships people have, people who might merely be watching the same event, for instance. If that was built on strong and vivid characterization, it would work. This book, however, has some good, some bad, portrayals, only one character's dialogue that rings true, and a disappointingly weak Irish dialogue, which I had looked forward to, the kind that puts the accent in your mind so clearly. Not there.
