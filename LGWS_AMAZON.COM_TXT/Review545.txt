This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book is told through many vignettes. Each one is told with the same formula: Loads, and loads and loads of exposition, with very little plot moving forward. Almost everything is backwards momentum. Where the excitement does come, however, is in the connections of the vignettes. That, to me, is what McCann is "doing" with this book, and yet those connections don't pay-off hard enough or often enough to have moved me greatly. And, the connections ultimately fail to really bring the book all together in a climax. I definitely sat through some tedious and/dubious characters to get to.... not much, really.
