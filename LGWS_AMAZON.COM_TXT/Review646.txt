This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
If one ever wanted to remember the New York of the 1970s (and who really would) Colum McCann's recent novel, "Let the Great World Spin", takes the reader back to a time when the city suffered in the bowels of woe. More than an economic mess, New York had everything else going against it, or so it seemed, and McCann wonderfully captures the seediness and the grit through his characters of immense variety. And for one brief moment, Philippe Petit soared over Manhattan, literally forcing New Yorkers to look skyward. With that central theme, McCann begins a six degrees of separation that largely succeeds.

Is this a book that can easily be picked up from time to time? Yes. While the characters in his novel are extraordinarily crafted and McCann's descriptions attract as much as they reek, large sections of "Let the Great World Spin" are given over to lengthy dialogue that slows down the narrative. Paring it down would have added some crispness, though the flavors that imbue the book are, nonetheless, to be savored. "Let the Great World Spin" is worth the read, but be prepared for a slow go.
