This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Please don't take that trite title for a review to indicate that this book is in anyway trite. It is a complicated, fascinating, and realistic view of a selection of New Yorkers in 1974 who in some way or the other experienced the wire walk of Petit between the two towers of the World Trade Center. No need to reconstruct the plot, but a note of several of the characters. I found Corrigan, who was attempting to literally live his life based on the teachings of Jesus, especially interesting. The prostitutes Tillie and Jazzlyn were also so well drawn and so complicated. The addition of such chapters as the one about the computer hackers in California added to the tangled web of interconnectiveness of all these characters. Phillipe Pettit is actually a minor character in the novel, but is so interesting; the first chapter describing the "walk" is one of the most engrossing I have ever read.

I did find the ending to be a bit too much "pulled together" but still believable. Also, the relationship between the white society lady, Clare, and Gloria, the Black mother who also lost a son in Vietnam not as believable as the rest of the connections.

Still, a fascinating read and if you love New York City, it's even better. Obviously written by a skilled writer.
