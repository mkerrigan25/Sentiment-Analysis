This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Colum McCann's exquisite prose is equaled by only one other contemporary writer - Mark Helprin. If you've read any of the latter's novels ("Winter's Tale" in particular)and thrilled to his gorgeous use of our language and the New York City setting, then you will take to McCann's story. It fascinates and enchants - a mostly gloomy tale in which lives intersect and revolve around a central point. Nevertheless, wondrously beautiful writing, which is so rarely encountered today.
