This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I remember being amazed at the tightrope walk between the then brand new twin towers. And this book, that starts out with the walker is just amazing! The voices of all the characters are interesting and you fall in love with most of them. This is my first book on Kindle and I read it fast. I'll have to go to the bookstore and flip through to the chapters and see what drawings I missed. I din't want to miss anything about this book - it is that good.
