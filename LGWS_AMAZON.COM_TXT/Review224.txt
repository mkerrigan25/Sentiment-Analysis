This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Colum McCann weaves an intricate, carefully crafted tale of life in New York City, as seen through a variety of unique individuals. It is a clever and inspiring vision of the deepest needs, cravings and survival techniques of very different people, whose lives are interconnected by happenstance. I loved it & ordered more of his books.
