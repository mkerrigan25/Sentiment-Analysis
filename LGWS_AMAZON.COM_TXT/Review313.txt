I really really wanted to love this book, but instead I find myself giving it 3.5/5 stars. Im not really sure why, the writing was very lyrical and McCann is clearly one of the better writers in terms of making you feel like you are actually looking in on the characters through a window and seeing it all unfold first-hand. He also switched well between all the different characters and changed 'voices' to make sure you were aware of their individual personality and story. I guess I just feel that while I was reading it I just got a little bit bored. There was nothing really propelling the storyline along other than just looking at a snap shot of their lives and what New York was like in that era.
