Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I am writing a review for this "purchase" because my fingers must have ordered it without my knowing. Amazon was very willing to have me return it and immediately send forms for doing so. I am very grateful for the service and am reconfirmed that Amazon is the easiest and most honest company to deal with online!
