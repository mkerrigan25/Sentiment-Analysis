This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
McCann is trying a set of styles in the novel; modern, post-modern? Not sure. It reads like James Frey's 'Bright Shiny Morning' at times, but more inter-related. The author shows that sentimentality is not dead in the modern novel, but he maintains a realistic perspective.
