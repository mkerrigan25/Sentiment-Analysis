This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I generally am patient about books but after hearing author Colum McCann interviewed on NPR,I went to my library. They had the book, but it was out. I ordered "Let the Great World Spin" online from Amazon and because I have "PRIME" ,it arrived in two days. I have certain criteria for judging books. The writing must be excellent, the characters believable, and the plot line must be progressing toward the answers. The narrative does not have to be riveting; I prefer evenness. Yet I admire an author who can pull me in to the narrative so well that I feel more like an observer than a reader.

"Let the Great World Spin" is the work of someone who knows his craft and who knows how to weave characters and more characters into a complicated plot It is a story of loss and hurt, of healing and hopefulness. First and last it is a story of love and connectedness. It is elegantly and beautifully written. It is NOT TO BE MISSED.
