This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This novel is truly a tour de force. The story, the writing, the structure, all pull the reader in to this spinning world. I found it hard to put down and images from the book keep popping into my head. I came to this book from seeing Colum McCallum on the Charlie Rose show. I'm so glad I saw that show!
