This book reminded me very much of, "Bonfire of the Vanities," by Tom Wolfe. McCann catches the diversity of a big city and the cultural and ethnic characteristics of the people living there. It's all tied together by the extraordinary daring of a Frenchman who walked on a tight wire between the twin towers in 1975. McCann has a fine ear for speech and is as comfortable speaking as a Park Avenue socialite as he is as a prostitute working the streets of the Bronx. It's a compelling story crafted by one of the better living authors.
