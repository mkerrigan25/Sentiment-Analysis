This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I read probably a book or two a week, and here it is 12/29/09, and this is the best book I've read this year! As I was reading this book, savoring the language, I felt deeply satisfied in the sense of something filling my soul. I am not gifted at literary review; I am not an editor. I can only say that the writing of this book seems extraordinary, a rare thing. I just now watched the clip of Colum McCann on this site, and he speaks of "channeling" the voices of the characters and of acting as a ventriliquist. He succeeds expertly at channeling disparate voices--and so many of them--from different races, socio-economic standing, and from different places--Ireland, Guatemala, and the United States (he seems to have New York City down pat and then there was Gloria with her Missouri roots). He made me love these people, these very different people. He helped me understand and also care about hookers in the Bronx, about a struggling single mother from Guatemala, and a judge in NYC who's life was not all it seemed to be once McCann helped us see beneath the veneer. These people are believable, both in the way they talk and the way they think, their interior lives. This is an outstanding book. I am not the first to say so; I just wanted to add my thoughts and thanks to so many others'. Congratulations to Mr. McCann for this amazing work of art!
