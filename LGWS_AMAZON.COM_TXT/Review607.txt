This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I typically am not one to leave reviews, but I felt the need to do so with this book. The characters in this novel really speak to the emotions in all of us. This is not your easy beach reader but instead is layered and complex. I think that this would be great required reading for a university literature class. It's a beautiful novel and I feel more enriched for reading it.
