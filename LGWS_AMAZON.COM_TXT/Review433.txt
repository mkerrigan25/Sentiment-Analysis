This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
It took me so long to get through the first half of this book but the second half, when McCann starts to bring all of the characters together, is where it gets so profound and amazing and moving that it will probably change my life. I think the author is so ambitious in the number of characters he tries to weave into the story (something like 11 characters I believe) that I realized, looking back, that he needed all of those first chapters to give each character life. When I got to the second half and had the ah-ha moment of seeing all of those characters and their lives intersect, it was like putting together an impossible 5,000 piece puzzle - so incredibly rewarding and meaningful. It's like life itself, really. How it takes time, and sometimes sadness, and sometimes patience to create a deep relationship with someone, but then doing that gets you to a place of incredible beauty. I am so glad I read this book. And I have to say that the epilogue McCann wrote is one of the most poignant pieces of writing I have ever seen.
