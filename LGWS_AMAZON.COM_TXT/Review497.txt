This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
The book starts strong but falters after a few chapters. I love McCann's turn-of-phrase, there are some real word jewels here. Every now & again there's a sentence that would have me setting the book down to ponder the original thought. But there were too many characters, none of whom was really the focus. It's supposed to be understood that the focus is the tightrope walker, but his presence is felt rather than experienced. That being said, I found the book to be lacking in depth, what with each chapter taking a turn with a new face. It's an interesting device that would've worked better if the characters could've been fleshed out more. What with tackling so many, there's a redundancy, in terms of these people questioning themselves, their lives, their regrets. That constant questioning after awhile became tedious.

I finished the book feeling as though I never had the pleasure of identifying or connecting with any character. Lots of surface skimming here. Still, I do so like his way with words and will seek out more by him. I recommend this with caveats. A good beach/airport read.
