I'm reading this at the same time as the World War II novel, Kindly Ones, so, perhaps that has had an effect. Any other time maybe a "good" man's struggle with religion, purity, sex, and altruism would seem really important. I marvel at any character's ability to walk stonily, silently, away from a conflict. Real or in a novel.

I'm put off by the fact that the narrator in the first part of the novel doesn't seem to have any kind of life of his own, reeling in his brother's pain seems to be the only thing he does. The story, however, is gritty and honest about the struggle to do "right". I absolutely love Tillie; can we have more of her, please?
