This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
Someone once said that a pessimistic economist is so much more likely bo be perceived as "serious" than one who is more optimistic. I wonder if the same thinking applies to fiction. Are serious/high-brow novels sort of expected to be pessimistic or, rather, grittily realistic?

I wish we had more great works of fiction that would abandon the beautiful-loser/missed-opportunity/tortured-soul path in favour of some grandiose and possibly humourous storytelling (no, I don't have statistics about the exact percentages of the two).

Colum McCann's "Let the Great World Spin" is a greatly accomplished novel, as the cover blurb is eager to point out. Yet it's also one of those melancholic books that I was mentioning just before.

The language is beautiful, and if write this too often is simply because I tend to read beautifully-written novels, the plot is engaging but...everything is sad and it eventually made me think about so many novels of this kind and, conversely, so few of the happy-variety, ultimately get awards. Of course McCann isn't to be blamed, he just happened to be the tipping point in my thinking.

"Let The Great World..." is about several interlocking narratives, all of which are set in 1974, when Philippe Petit, a French tighrope walker, famously crossed the empty space between the Twin Towers. Petit is the only real-life character in the novel and he appears only briefly but he somehow sets in motion ("spinning", you could say) the other facts narrated in the book.

A radical Irish Monk, a mother-daughter prostitute duo, a judge, a failed artist, etc. Those are the main characters whom McCann uses to tell the story of NYC in a specific time. As I wrote, enjoyable and very elegantly done. Now give me some humour, please.
