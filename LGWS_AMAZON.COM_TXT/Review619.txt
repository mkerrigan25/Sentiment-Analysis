This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
McCann's novel-in-stories is a big, sloppy, urgent, bittersweet, hard-edged, sentimental look at a group of people trying their best to live in New York City in the 1970's. It is a harsh world; Vietnam is raging and claiming countless lives, prostitution and crime are rampant, and there is a general feeling of melancholy in the air. Enter Philip Petit, whose tightrope walk between the WTC towers forms the nucleus from which these stories disperse, coalesce, and yes, spin. This is a book to give yourself up to, written with such conviction and rare perception that it overruns the story's occasional lapses in structure. Every character, from salt-of-the-earth Corrigan to quietly mourning WASP Claire is finely drawn, relatable, and endearing. Also of note is the book's diversity in the different formats it is written in, making you feel that you really are listening to a group of highly different individuals speak. Always moving and distinctly human without ever being boring, this is rare and exciting contemporary fiction, and my pick for the most satisfying book of the year.
