What can I say. McCann is good. Very good. His capacity to breath life into his characters is a true gift. I was born in '74 and have a real nostalgia for that decade. I also live in New York City (20yrs) and his depiction of life as it exists in so many varieties here is not only believable, but extraordinary.
