This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This is only the second book I have ever sent back. I slogged through more than half of this book waiting for it to get good; Then I gave up and sent it back.

The tightrope walker was a spectacular event and the idea of the book was good. However, the short stories were about various prostitutes, misfits, drug addicts, and others. Why not include some normal people? Some of the stories were poorly written and poorly connected.

I wonder why it was given such a good recommendation; maybe to sell the book?
