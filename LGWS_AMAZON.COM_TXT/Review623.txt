I have never read this author before but will be sure to read more of his work. What a wonderful writer! What a talent! He writes in multiple voices painting a portrait of life circling around the events occuring in 1974 when Petit walked a tightrope across the gap between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York. But the novel isn't so much about Petit's feat as about life itself, and the City, and the way people and their histories bump up and against each other to create the ever-flowing movement of time from the present to the future. It is about the human experience and it is luminous, even when McCann describes heroin-addicted street-walkers or a teenager searching the tunnels of the subway system for graffiti. It is rare that such gritty realism can nevertheless leave the reader feeling inspired and grateful for the full range of our human experience.
