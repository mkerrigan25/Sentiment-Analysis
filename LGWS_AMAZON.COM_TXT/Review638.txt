This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This book is more like a collection of interrelated short stories than a novel. Each chapter introduces a new character, usually related to the previous characters. They are all connected via their relation to the historic moment when Philip Petit walked a tight rope between the twin towers of the world trade center, shortly before their completion in 1974.

The chapters vary in style and quality, but the good ones are really very good. The author uses beautiful poetic, emotional language, and the strong parts of the book range from ecstatic to heartbreaking. The beginning of the book is a bit slow, but I recommend that you stick it out for at least the first quarter. If you haven't been moved by that point (which is hard for me to imagine), then this book is not for you.

More about the language: The book is written in a staccato style. Lots of sentence fragments. Sometimes more like poetry than prose. Not always making sense. But beautiful. Sometimes I felt that the language was not entirely authentic, that is sometimes it did not sound like a New York novel, but rather an Irish novel about New York. But this can be forgiven.

I have heard it claimed that this book is a 9/11 novel. I don't buy it. It has the world trade center and it has tragedy, but aside from that I can see no relation to 9/11. However it is still a beautiful book.
