This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Kindle edition
Buying this book was a waste of money. It is pretentious, It rings false, and as an example, the prologue treatment of the world trade center skywalk reads like a b minus creative writing assignment. This is not new york deeper than others have gone before. The list of books that do new york better is long and varied.lllll
