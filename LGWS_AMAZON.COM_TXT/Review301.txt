This excellent novel weaves together diverse characters in unusual ways. Set in NYC in the 70's, we learn about life among prostitutes and saints in South Bronx, grief in a Central Park penthouse, a judge's decision, wreckage and death, the salvage of dignity, and how all these lives wind together like a tightrope.
