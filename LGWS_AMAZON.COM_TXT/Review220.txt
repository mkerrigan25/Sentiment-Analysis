It took a bit to understand how this story was unfolding, but then it just did...in a way that seemed at once abstract and real. The separate yet connected lives and personalities had a familiarity to them that made it comfortable to explore even the most difficult aspects of their individual stories. Beautifully written, beautifully told.
