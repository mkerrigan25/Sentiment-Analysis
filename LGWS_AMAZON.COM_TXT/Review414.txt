This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I bought this book based on all the positive feedback from critics and Frank McCourt but I couldn't get past his style of writing to really enjoy the work. He uses too many short, clipped sentences like something a high school student would use to write a homework assignment. The ball is round.The round ball is blue. Blue is the color of the sky. blah blah blah.

But I do agree it started out very nicely in Ireland but once we hit NYC, I became less interested in the characters and story.
