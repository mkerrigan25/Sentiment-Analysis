This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I bought this book right after Amazon declared it the best book of 2009. Do I think it deserves that title? Not really. There were far better books out in 2009, however this should in no way diminish this interesting a little hard to read book or collection of short stories about a bunch of people and how their lives and decisions affect each other either directly or through intermediaries. The best thing about this book is that it never gets boring and will leave you wanting to know more about the various characters in the book.
