This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
The book sucks you in, and weaves you through life in NYC in 1974 through the eyes of many intersecting souls. It is like Bonfire of the Vanities, but written with much more craft. He captures so many voices so well. It was like watching Jamie Foxx play Ray Charles in Ray or Nathaniel Ayers in the Soloist - you forget he isn't Ray or Nathaniel soon into the movie. Reading this book you forget that it is actually fiction and you yearn to see what happens next in each life. Brilliant - can't wait for his next book.
