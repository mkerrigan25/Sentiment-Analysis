This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
The concept was wonderful. The background research the author must have done to get inside the heads of hookers and monks and Park Avenue neurotics and courtrooms and jails and street smarts was impressive. But the novel just took too long to come full circle.
