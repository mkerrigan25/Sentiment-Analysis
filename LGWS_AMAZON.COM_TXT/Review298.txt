This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A book that just blows you away. It is not a book that you read in one sitting. I sometimes stopped reading and closed the book, because that one sentence was so powerful, so beautiful written that I could not keep on reading. The stories are so intricately woven, yet so balanced that it is magical. While you know that the tight-rope walker will keep his balance high above, the people below are loosing theirs...and yet. Brilliant, brilliant book.
