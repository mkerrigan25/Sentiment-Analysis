This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I have found a new favorite in Colum McCann.
Reading this wonderful novel, which at first appears to be a series of unrelated short stories, was an experience of one highlighter moment after another. I teach literature at a two-year college, and this will certainly make its way onto my syllabus the next time I teach introduction to the novel. It toys with the possibilities of the novel and the possibilities of life; this work will stay with me.
