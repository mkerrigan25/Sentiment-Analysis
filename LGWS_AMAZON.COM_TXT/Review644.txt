This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Colum McCann's new novel, Let the Great World Spin, presents the voices of multiple characters connected in ways that prove that even in a huge city like New York, we live in community and have an impact on the lives of those around us. The voices of multiple characters present dimensions of a time in 1974 that are true to that time and remind us of our lives today. Tying together each voice is the highwire stunt of Philippe Petit when he walked on a tightrope between the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. The cast of characters presents the city and the community in its fullness: young artists; hookers on drugs trying to raise children; a street priest; a Park Avenue judge; a support group of women who lost sons in the Vietnam War. Love, sorrow, redemption and understanding fill the pages of Let the Great World Spin. As McCann notes on page 349, "The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough." However you stumble along in this world, one or more characters will resonate with you and your life. McCann's lyrical writing soars, and there's great satisfaction and joy to be found in reading Let the Great World Spin.

Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
