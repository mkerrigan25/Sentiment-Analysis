This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
It was an interesting read. I wasn't sure where the plot was going until I had read a few chapters about different characters and how their lives would eventually all come together. I was most intrigued with how the story of the tight rope walker was woven around the stories of the other characters. I was really intrigued with the stories of the two Irish brothers were intertwined with Tillie and Jazzlyn.
