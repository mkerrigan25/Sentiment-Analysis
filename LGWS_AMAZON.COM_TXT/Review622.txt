This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I love great fiction and literature and was eager to read this book based on the editors' choice recommendation. The book starts off strong and promising with a taut first chapter and there is the underlying promise that there would be some grand unifying theme and structure to the book. Instead, there are essentially a handful of disjointed character portrayals, some of which are well-developed and very good and some are rather weak, and we learn that the character's lives touch each other in a narrow fashion. There was some great word-smithing going on which gives this book some essence of literature, but at times it seemed like the author was trying to hard to add such an element. In the end the book fell short.
