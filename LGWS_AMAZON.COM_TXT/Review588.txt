This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I was given this book from a dear friend of mine and did not know what to expect. I almost stopped reading this book half way through it but I am glad I finished it. I grew up in NYC in the 1970's and many descriptions of what was going on in the City are accurate. I was lucky enough to see Philippe Petit walk the tighrope that day. The first half of the book describes the underbelly of the City and many of the bottom of the barrel characters, prostitutes, drug dealers, street hustlers, etc. In my view the book slowly turns into a modern day version of "It's A Wonderful Life". The title of my review is from page 339. If we reflect on our life how many unopened envelopes does each of us have and if they were opened where would it have led to and how different would our lives have been. I will not high brow this nor summarize the book, many others have done it before me. This is a highly recommended book and make sure to read slowly and savor the last third of the book.
