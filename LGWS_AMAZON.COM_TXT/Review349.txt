This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
Using the Vietnam War and the Twin Towers as crutches for this story wasn't a bad choice. The plot revolving around several characters of whom are all connected by a common experience isn't really a plot at all. This story is really several stories of multiple characters who exist at different levels in society. And that's it; they just exist. I am at a loss with respect to this author's intent regarding his reason for writing a story about hookers, a religious fanatic and his brother, a failed artist and a widow who has also lost her son as well as another woman who adopts two children who were the hooker's kids. The stories of each character, while interesting, don't deliver any insight or depth about the overall theme of this novel. Was it destitution, hopelessness, resentment, loss, hope, faith, indifference? I still can't figure it out. While the author has some talent in his voice, I can't say this novel deserved to come close to an award yet alone receive it. What were the other finalists? Sometimes I think the fix is in as I have made attempts to read other "award winners", but didn't even bother to write a review as they went into the donate pile. Like the let down at the end of the movie "Up in the Air", this book disappointed.
