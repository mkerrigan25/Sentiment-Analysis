Reading this novel by Colum McCann required some patience. The author gives us several seemingly unrelated chapters which require our imagination to make the needed connections. I enjoy the challenge which McCann presents. The reader needs to have faith in the author that the stories will all mesh and make sense. They do and all the intellectual challenge is worth the effort for the reader. The novel is unique and very special.
