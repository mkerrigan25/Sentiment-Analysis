This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I was very excited to read this book after I read a lot of great reviews of it. Perhaps I was built up for it a tad too much, because I just felt disappointed with the results. McCann is a great writer, capable of spinning some beautiful prose, but he is also capable of clunky schmaltz. Every time I came across a particularly flowery sentence I just wanted to groan -- which is not a great recommendation for a book. There are moments of brilliance, but they get bogged down in stories that are wildly varied in terms of quality. It is also disappointing that the centerpiece of the collection -- Philippe Petit's walk between the towers -- feels so marginal and insignificant in parts. I frequently felt disinterested in the stories and the lives depicted, so it took me a long time to slog my way through. Ultimately, I can see why people like this book, but I am surprised that it has garnered as much praise as it has. It's good, but in my opinion it is definitely not great.

Grade: C
