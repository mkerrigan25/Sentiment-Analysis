5.0 out of 5 stars Best Book I've ever read, June 29, 2014
By Nicole P - See all my reviews
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Beautifully written. This book made me want to be a writer. After reading Let the Great World Spin I read Colum McCann's other books Dancer and This Side of Brightness. Can't wait to read Zoli.
