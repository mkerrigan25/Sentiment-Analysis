This had been recommended to me and when I started reading it I thought I might quite enjoy it but I didn't really in the end and found myself barely glancing over sections of text just to get through it. I know others who did enjoy it so it's probably just not my cup of tea. I thought it had the makings of a really good story but that kind of got lost along the way with too many characters getting involved but at the same time not really involved, just on the periphery.
