This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Let the Great World Spin is a brilliant novel that reads as a collection of overlapping short stories. Some characters are more detailed than others, but each one is extremely complex and interesting. The majority of the novel takes place in the Summer of 1974 as the author returns throughout to the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center of Philippe Petit. It is through this act that we are able to tie most of the events to a particular day.

In each chapter, you are able to to get into the minds of characters who by the end of the novel, are all connected. The characters include John Corrigan (a monk/priest who is a friend and protector of a group of prostitutes who live outside his project), Corrigan's brother, Tilly and Jazzlyn (mother and daughter prostitutes), Gloria (the woman who adopts Jazzlyn's children), Claire (the wife of the judge who presides over the hearings of the tightrope walker, Tilly and Jazzlyn) and many others. The detail of the crime in New York City at this time is amazing, as are the descriptions of current events relevant to that time. The characters' reflections on their past makes each one come alive and, despite their flaws, you can't help but be moved by them.

It is interesting that Corrigan, who I believe is really at the center of this book, is never written in the first person. We learn of his short life strictly through how other characters viewed him. Even at the end of the novel, when we are taken to the year 2006, Jazzlyn's daughter is still reflecting on the life of Corrigan and wants to learn more about him.

If you are looking for a light read, this is not the book for you. It is, however, a book that will stay with you for days after you complete it.
