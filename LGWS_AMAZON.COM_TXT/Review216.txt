This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Reading this novel was like looking at a masterpiece painting. The language was beautiful and depicted characters that you loved and those that you didn't like so much, but wanted to keep reading anyway. The story of all of these diverse lives woven together with the impact of a moment. I will keep reading this author.

I give it 4 stars because, although it was beatifully written, I've read books that I like better. So, 5 stars for technical and 4 stars for story.
