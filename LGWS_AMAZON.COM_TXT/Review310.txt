This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Kindle Edition)
This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Interweaving the lives and stories of a variety of persons and events is done masterfully here. The characters become known and important to the reader. There are events in their lives, great and small, which carry the story and character development forward.

I will read this again.
