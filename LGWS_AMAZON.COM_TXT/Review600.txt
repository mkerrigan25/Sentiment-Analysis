This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I found Let the Great World spin to be an interesting series of intertwined stories. The book has a poignant melancholy about it, as all the stories involve tragic loss. But at the same time, the author does a nice job giving glimpses of human beauty, even in those who society generally discards.

The intertwining stories are loosely connected by a tight rope walker who illegally walked between the newly built, but not yet completed World Trade Center towers in the 1970's (the movie Man on Wire documents his feat. Pretty amazing). The connection never really worked for me. I struggled understanding how the wire walker had anything to do with the characters; it seemed like the author picked an event out of a hat and just went with it. I suppose the wire walker cements the story in a specific period when the twin towers represented hope and promise prior to their demise on 9/11, but the connection to the actual characters was clumsy. Some reviews call this a 9/11 book, but that seems anecdotal, as only the final section takes place post 9/11, and even that does not draw any connection between the characters and the twin towers.

Some of the mundane stuff in this book is drawn out too long, as the author appeared to be more worried about each descriptive word he used than tying the plot together. I expected a little more intrigue in how these vastly different lives diverged.

So all in all, this a well written book that brings the reader into the lives of diverse and interesting characters; but that is about as far as it goes. As a story...its just so-so. If Amazon did half stars, I would have gone with 3 1/2, but its definitely better than 3....not quite sure it's a 4 though....
