This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback 

Irish writer Colum McCann has a nice 'James Joyce-ian' stream of consciousness style to his writing. An early scene, weaving the car rides of two brothers through New York City streets, was engaging.

Unfortunately, as a veteran who has friends that served in Vietnam, I stopped reading when Mr. McCann introduced a character who was supposedly stationed in country by orders of the president to get accurate number counts for our dead by computer hacking. US fighting forces have a history dating back to the Civil War that we don't leave our dead behind. That tradition, along with payroll records, pretty much gives a good number count for our casualties. Additionally, McCann has his character take frequent trips outside to cool off from working on the computer equipment room. Having worked for a mainframe computer company in the '70's, and subsequently installed and maintained control equipment for decades, the one place a body can be sure to cool off is the equipment room. There,temperatures are kept cool and brisk to prevent equipment from overheating! Here's one last fine point, the Communications people in Vietnam usually maintained equipment in special truck convoys -- to keep mobile and to control the temperature with aux generators.

Great works of fiction are great because real people can relate to the environment and circumstances of the story. It would seem as if Mr. McCann didn't bother to check with a Vietnam vet with regards to the circumstances of that character's situation. Too bad, there are still a lot of them kicking around.
