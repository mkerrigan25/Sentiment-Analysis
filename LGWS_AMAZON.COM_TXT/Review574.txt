This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Nice writing, but way too depressing to finish. As a lifelong NYC-er born in the Bronx, I really wanted to like this book but stopped reading it halfway through. Couldn't take all the suffering.

The New York Times Book Review compared this novel to BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES by Tom Wolfe. I don't think so . .
