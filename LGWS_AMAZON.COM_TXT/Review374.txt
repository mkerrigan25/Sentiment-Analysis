This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Kindle edition
I found this book overly sappy, long winded and written as if only to tug emotions. I found the writing to be extremely pointless and tedious. After the first section about the monk living in NYC in the 70s I did not care about any of the characters. I was so disappointed because this book had come highly recommended but I truly hated it and found it painfully boring and tedious to read. I admit that I actually skimmed some sections just to get through it. I felt it had a pro-religious undertone which also did not interest me. I do not recommend this book at all.
