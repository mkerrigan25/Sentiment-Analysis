This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
At times it was difficult to know who was narrating, but overall I loved this novel. The writing and the research were superb. The novel captures so much of what New York City was during the era described. But above all that, the story of loss and grief is one all readers can relate to.
