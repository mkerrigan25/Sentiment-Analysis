This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Extremely well-written book with excellent character development. Book blends and connects the lives of the different characters, via a tightrope walker. Although I recognize the brilliance of this book, it is, nevertheless, filled with tragedy and generally depressing. Such is life.
