This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
My all-time favourite book. It's got such a rare quality - that raw, poignant, honest subtlety that I've only seen sparingly before. It tells the story of characters caught up in addiction, love and family ties, and all are cleverly drawn together by the 'tightrope walker in the sky'. The characters are flawed, genuine, touching and very, very human, and their lives are original and intertwined, often connected by hope and the bonds between them.
It's a beautiful, powerful book with an elaborate story and I've never read anything like it.
