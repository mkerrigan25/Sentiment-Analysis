I always look forward to beginning a book by Colum McCann. This book doesn't disappoint. His stories are engaging and captivating, his characters are always intriguing and that's true in this novel as well. It makes you feel like you were in New York in 1974 and holding your breath while the action takes place. Intriguing throughout the entire story.
