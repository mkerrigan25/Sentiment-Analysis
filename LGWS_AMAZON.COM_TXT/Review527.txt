This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This was, by far, not the worst book I've ever read, but it comes close. All the "tricky" devices the author uses, like 1rst person, present tense, etc. are all ineffective. The author doesn't choose to let the reader in on on what he's getting at, until much later in the book. As a reader I felt manipulated and disrespected, having to plow through so much bad writing to reach the conclusion that there wasn't much substance to begin with. Any writing book will tell you to avoid the devices this author uses constantly. My question is: Just because the author has been published before, does he not have a content editor?

The characters are not interesting, maintly because of the writing style. There is nothing to draw the reader in from the first paragraph.

I find it quite amazing that this book would become a best seller, or even that a publisher would look twice at this manuscript.
