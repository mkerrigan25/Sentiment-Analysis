This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I am fairly certain that had this book been published when I was in college, it would have been assigned reading in one of my courses.This is definitely not a novel that one would give to a friend who is about to vacation at the beach.
As I've gotten older, I've discovered that required reading was intended to make me think, and now I actually enjoy it (who'd a thunk it).There is much to think about in this novel.
Foremost, in my mind is the author's choice of characters to write about. He has chosen to depict human fraility as resplendant with drugs, crime, veniality and personal arrogance. Yes, redeeming characteristics are present, but it is those on the fringe of society that the author wants us to think about and disect. Is it any wonder that our hero (Corrigan) dresses in black given the depressing portrayal of most of the characters. Is this a slice of life we need to spend time examining? I think so. My wife did not.
I can think of no higher compliment to an excellent writer than "he/she has a way with words" Colum McCann is such a writer, which makes reading whatever he writes worthwhile.
Which leaves us with the searing question, what's with the man on the wire? I'm saving that answer for my term paper.
