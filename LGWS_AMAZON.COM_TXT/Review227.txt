This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I bought this book for a book club assignment, and it was really interesting. There were parts that I felt dragged on and/or were confusing. The book club didn't help clarify my confusion. But it is enjoyable "high" reading. Not summer hammock reading.
