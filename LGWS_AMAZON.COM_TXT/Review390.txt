This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This is a wonderfully complex and somber novel, but beautifully written.

McCann uses the story of Phillipe Petit, the French acrobat who walked a wire strung between the twin towers in 1974, to illustrate man's resilience, even in the face of great obstacles.

He further illustrates it through the lives of "normal folks" going about their business hundreds of feet below the high wire, down on the varied streets of New York. Regardless of their backgrounds and socio-economic status, they all struggle with unique issues and yearn for connection with another human being. And as the novel unfolds, we learn that all of their lives are interconnected...not just by a shared witnessing of the high-wire walk, but through a series of events that unfold around it, none of which could have been predicted.

Let the Great World Spin is a story of love and loss, of "life passing through difficulty in order to achieve any modicum of beauty," and the human ability to find meaning even in the greatest of tragedies. It is not a light read - it takes some focus to realize the interconnectedness of the many protagonists - but it is a rewarding read, one that will get you thinking about your own place in this world as it spins round and round.
