This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
No matter who we are, where we come from, what the social status we all just want one thing: Happiness, respect, compassion.
The reader will find all that in the characters of this story. Setting is in NYC, and if you've lived in NYC especially one can identify
with the characters. The lonely, the down and out, the optimistic, the saviors, the pessimists.... they are all there and all connected
with the great thing we call Life.
A wonderful read, smartly woven together.
