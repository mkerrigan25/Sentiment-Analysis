This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The style of writing was not my favorite. For lack of a better description, I would say it was too choppy in the way it jumped from one story to another before it arrived at the relationship of the characters. However, I think that the character development was good for the most part. Not my best read but by far not the worst.
