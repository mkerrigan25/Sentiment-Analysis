This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A very fine read. Highly inventive and quite extraordinary in its ability to present an alternative (and very brave) way of living one's life, and changing the lives of those both in proximity and much less so. If you have a creative soul and believe in the old "safety in numbers, more fun, too" adage (also described by the B-52s as "others like you," don't hesitate -- order this one up straight away.
