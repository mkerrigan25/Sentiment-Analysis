This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Yes, it's a good choice for an interesting and philosophical story about happenings at the Twin Towers and about interplay of people from Park Avenue to the bowels of the city. Life continues , people struggle with what life throws their way and tragedy happens along with the everyday happenings of the daring and everyday life choices. A good read that seems to start out slow but soon grabs your attention.
