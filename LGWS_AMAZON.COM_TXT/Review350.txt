This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
This book is fantastic on every level. Going into it, I thought that this was a collection of short stories. Instead, we follow different characters whose stories are all related, thus adding to a great feeling of connection that strengthens the book and makes it more compelling. McCann also does a great job of speaking in the voices of so many different people from different walks of life. And when he does so, his prose has a kind of poetry within it. Another review called it 'lyrical', and I would say that that is appropriate. But with each different voice used, he must use a different kind of poetic voice. In that sense, McCann does a good job of capturing the inner moments and quiet moments that are better captured in books than in films. But he also does a good job with the specific action of the events of the book, making the reader feel as if he or she were right there watching the events unfold.

I am very glad that I took a chance on this one. It is the best book that I have read in years.
