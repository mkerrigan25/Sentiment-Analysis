This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
That high-wire act in August, 1974. One man, with a little help from his friends, an unusual man who didn't allow notions of impossibility to sully his dreams into nullity, that man walked, hopped skittered danced and jumped from one World Trade Center tower to the other.

They were new then, those towers. And no one could possible conceive what would happen 27 years later. But thinking back, looking at a high-wire act for the ages that also happens to frame the stories told in Colum McCann's "Let the Great World Spin", and you can't help but think what a perfect recipe for metaphor, for a new way to understand --and muddle through -- this world we live in.

That high-wire act is above all things, every single life lived.

It's not a new idea for a novel. In some way every novel, even the terrible ones, maybe even especially the terrible ones, try to and somehow always achieve if only slightly, a new description of the world -- a prescription of the author's beliefs about our world -- and sometimes a proscription against it.

Personally, and what review isn't personal, I can be moved, displaced from my own perception of the world and into someone else's, but only when the novel is truly good, well-written, lyrical, effortless. And this one is.

Just let it swallow you up, let go. And as the stories move from one carefully drawn protagonist to another, as this great world of characters slowly grows into a portrait of our America in the 1970s, our world before 9/11, let the nuances within them, the special moments McCann crafts into his novel surprise you, move you to twinges of sadness and joy, and carry you away into the beauty, the grace in every single moment we have together.
