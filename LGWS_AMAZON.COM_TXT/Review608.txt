This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I listen to many audio books. I ran across this on audible. When I saw that the author shares the same last name as myself, I thought I'd give it a whirl. I know not if I am related to this author, but I would be proud to say I am. The telling of this story was a real treat as I am always searching for the ways in which we connect, and we are all connected in one way or another.

If this book where a painting it would already be considered a masterpiece as it is truly a master work.
