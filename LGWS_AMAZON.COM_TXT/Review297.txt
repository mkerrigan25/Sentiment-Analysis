This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A masterfully-crafted novel in which a host of characters are linked through an association (sometimes direct, sometime ephemeral) with the wire-walker who walked between the two towers of the (former) World Trade Center.
In a lesser author's hands, this could have made for a gimmicky novel. However, in this work it emerges as a carefully-crafted work of genius. Even granting that, however, the true strength of this work is the portrayal of the inner lives of the many characters who pass through the times and events of the novel's setting. This author deals with a great variety of characters, nearly all broken in some way, or at least lacking some importants parts, but he does so with great deal of love and understanding, both for them individually and for the collective human condition.
The unstated but abiding theme is the search for redemption, given the vagaries of how each character defines redemption and how they seek after it.
