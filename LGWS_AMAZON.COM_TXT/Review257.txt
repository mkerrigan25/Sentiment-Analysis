4.0 out of 5 stars As I define it, anyway..., April 24, 2013

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I recently read Molly Ringwald's book 'When It Happens To You; A Novel in Stories'. (And reviewed it here on Amazon.) So a comparison between that work and this one was screaming out to be had.

I have (an admittedly arbitrary) way of looking at different craftspeople.

There are vocalists...and then there are singers.

There are guitar players...and then there are guitarists.

There are people who write...and then there are writers.

Molly Ringwald is a person who writes. Colum McCann is a writer.

Both of them have taken short stories about an assembly of characters and woven them together. 'Overlap' is the theme of the day.

I believe Mr. McCann succeeds in telling a good story more than Ms Ringwald. (Although I don't believe the device served even his tale well. Oh, and I could have done without almost all the material about the two Irish brothers in NYC.)

He certainly has more chops; I think there were a tiny handful of sections in hers where I sat back in admiration, whereas his contained all kinds of gems. (A couple of them were stellar, reminiscent of Frank DeLillo's beaut, the opening forty-or-so pages of 'Underworld'.) I felt I was in the company of someone with substantial talent, and was entertained by his skill and passion...if not necessarily by the overall story arc.

I'd love to have heard him do a reading when the novel was first released.
