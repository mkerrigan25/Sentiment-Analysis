This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book follows multiple characters in multiple places, but then it ties them all together at the end. It is delightful and deep at the same time and centers around the true events of the day in 1974 when Phillipe Petit did an unauthorized wire walk between the Twin Towers. I believe Colum McCann is attempting to show how each of us walks our own death defying tightrope every day. We may walk it alone and without fanfare, but it is just as frightening and ultimately exhilarating as Petit's walk. To quote McCann- "I sit here thinking about how much courage it takes to live an ordinary life." We do not all have to perform grand, exciting public feats to be heroes. There are millions of heroes living ordinary lives.
