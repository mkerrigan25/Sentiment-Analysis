This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
One of the most highly-admired, disappointments of my literary life. Perhaps, just perhaps, if you are a life-long New Yorker, and enjoy the despondency and desperation of that city, you may be able to tolerate this work.
The author is talented, his descriptive analysis of events and people is extraordinary, but his outlook is jaded and seriously mean.
I read a book a week and this one made for a very depressing week.
