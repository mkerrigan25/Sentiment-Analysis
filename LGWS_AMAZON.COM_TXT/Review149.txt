This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
No doubt this novel is well-written but perhaps that's just the trouble with it. The author seems bent on writing somethng beautiful and profound and misses the basics like character development, for example. The whole time I'm reading about characters that I just don't care about! Why? Because I don't know them. Each vignette is told iusing a first person narrative, and in two of the three vignettes the character telling the story is so self-absorbed that the characters around them lack substance. In the first part, with the catholic priest, it's the opposite problem. The priest's brother tells the story of his eccentric Mother Theresa-type sibling who takes over the story to the point that the narrator remains flat and two-dimensional on the page. His (the narrator's) behavior is unexplainable and unpredictable because the reader doesn't know him and therefore doesn't know what to expect. Colum McCann should take heed from such wonderful novels as The Great Gasby or Netherland by joseph O'Neill both of which use a first-person narrative to develop the main character of the novel. However in both of these works those described and those describing are equally-well developed.
