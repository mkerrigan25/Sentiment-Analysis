This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Within the first few pages of starting this novel I knew that it was going to be good. It had the big three- characters, story, and writing.

The Characters
- The way McCann connects his characters is both subtle and obvious at the same time. I always wonder about minor characters, what they back stories are, and how they became the way they are. This book provides that information, taking seemingly small characters from other points in the book and then making them the focus for a later chapter.
- The characters are so very damaged. Hookers, mothers of dead sons, a struggling religious zealot, to name a few. Through this struggle they bond and learn how to survive.

The Story
- Everyone in this novel is connected, in some way, by a man who is walking on a tightrope between the Twin Towers, most of which have just seen him.
- There's no true whole plot, just a lot of stories- and that's okay. There doesn't need to be a beginning and an end.

The Writing
- McCann has a way with words- they flow out perfectly for each character he's portraying. Everyone has a voice. Their spirits are captured in his writing.

Just read it.
