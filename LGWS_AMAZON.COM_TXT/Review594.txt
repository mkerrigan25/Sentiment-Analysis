This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I bought this book because of all the good reviews. I didn't think it lived up to those reviews. I finished the book but it was not one of my favorites of 2009. The book had several characters going at once that the author tried to connect to one event but I didn't feel the connection.
