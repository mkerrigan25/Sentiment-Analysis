This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
It was a bit confusing at the beginning, because it is not a simple narrative with a beginning and an end, happy or otherwise. It is beautifully written and every character (there were many!) is brought to life in an absorbing, gripping manner. It is a tapestry of New York City woven skillfully. The reader should continue reading; you won't regret it.
