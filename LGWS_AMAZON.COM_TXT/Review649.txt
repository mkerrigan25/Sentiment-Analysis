This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Maybe you have to live in NY, and have been around for 9/11, but even if you don't or weren't, read this book! I am writing this through the tears that it has brought out from deep inside (many times througout). My wife and I moved to NY in January of 1974 from college, and were here for the pivotal event that binds these stories together. And we're here still, through all of the tough times this city has endured and continues to. I will NOT reveal any of the story, other than to say it is picture perfect in it's imagery, tone, and resolution. Read it and know what the human condition is all about. It is possibly one of the best books I have ever read, and I've read a lot. Writing this is not something I would normally do, but have to. Spend the time and read it, you won't be able to stop. Believe me!
