This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
When books consistently change perspective, it can be annoying. Just as you get involved with some characters, a new chapter starts and you are supposed to start caring about some unfamiliar people and situations. However, when the author is a master of voice, like in this case with Colum McCann, you don't care. You go along with anyone he wants to introduce you to, and it takes about a page before you are immersed in the new perspective.

Let the Great World Spin keeps things popping. You get to meet a myriad of sharply drawn, distinct characters-- from Jazz a hooker "on the stroll" in the Bronx, to the judge who sentenced Philip Petit, to Corrigan (the most wonderful character of all-- an Irish immigrant attempting to fulfill a spiritual calling in the slums of NYC)-- and observe the overlap and interconnectedness of human experience. The shifts happen quickly and the story never drags.

It is also a period piece. You live and breath New York City in the early seventies which is a pretty interesting time and place to visit-- the graffiti writers, the drug use, the Vietnam hangover, the postmodern artists. The storytelling had that edgy dirtiness that I like, but is also touching and brings you to deeper themes about human frailty and the layered quality of our experiences. It resonates after you are done reading it like all great books do.
