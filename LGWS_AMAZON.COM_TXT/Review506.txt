This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Other than knowing that this book revolved around the renowned tightrope walk between the twin towers of The World Trade Center in the 1970s. After three chapters, I mistakenly thought this was a book of short stories. McCann deftly weaves the story through chapters which introduce seemingly new characters who have tangently been involved in the story. A masterpiece.
