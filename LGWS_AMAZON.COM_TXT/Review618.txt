This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Lyrical, passionate, and utterly engrossing, Colum McCann's new novel is a brilliant kaleidoscope of characters longing for something greater than an ordinary life, yet struggling to make that happen. It takes its place beside Zoli and Dancer as one of the best contemporary novels I've read in recent years. A bravura performance.
