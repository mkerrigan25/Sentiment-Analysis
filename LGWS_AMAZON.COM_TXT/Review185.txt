This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
My son was assigned this book for summer reading. He'd give it four stars which automatically makes it five stars for me - anything my kid actually enjoys reading is a winner. However I actually read it myself and thought it was wonderful. Don't even bother with the reviews, just read the darn thing.
