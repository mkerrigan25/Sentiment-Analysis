Excellent book. This book is filled with wonder and Colum McCann can be admired and respected for both the idea of such a book and being able to accomplish it in the writing and organization. I became attached to his characters and thought about them after the book was finished --- obviously the mark of master writer. This book seems to be a metaphor for the "tight rope" of our lives, the tenuousness, the magnetic lure for balance, the courage to proceed without knowing, and of course the backbone for it all -- the inevitable, insatiable, necessary longing to give and receive love. Great reading!
