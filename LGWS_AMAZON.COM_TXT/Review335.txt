This review is from: Let the Great World Spin kindle edition
It's been awhile now since I read this book, but I cannot get its badness out of my mind. The Kindle free chapter was decent, so I bought the book expecting more of the same--what a mistake that was! For anyone who downloads the freebie and likes it, beware. I am hoping this is not a new marketing trick, write a coherent first chapter to hook the Kindle readers then the h*ll with the rest of it once the sale is made...

"Let the Great World Spin" is juvenile and pretentious--does anyone over the age of nineteen or so still think hookers and other assorted lowlifes are a sophisticated and interesting subject? Well, evidently the guy who wrote this book does.

This thing loves itself desperately, I did not share that love as I read it and still feel shame that I was stupid enough to buy it. Yet, having already squandered my hard earned money, I did slog through to the end, god knows how, but I did, and I am ashamed about that, too, the hours of my life I will never get back...

So, for anyone who feels an overwhelming need to read this embarrassing mess, do yourself and your wallet a favor and borrow it from your local library.
