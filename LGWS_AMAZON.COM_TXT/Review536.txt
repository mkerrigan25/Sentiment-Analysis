This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I came back to this novel several times, thinking I should get it. And now I am so glad I bought it. It is one of the most cativating reads I have come across in a long time. The author really knows how to just grab the reader and pull them in. Once the last page was read, I wanted more. And I had questions, so I had to go back through it. The bottom line: A great read. Don't pass it up!!!
