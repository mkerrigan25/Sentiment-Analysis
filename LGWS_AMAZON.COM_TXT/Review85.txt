This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
The description of the wire walker was lyrical, precise and a delight. The grittier parts of the novel, because they are written so vividly, are sometimes hard to read, but viscerally "true". The author's structure - seemingly disparate, but actually nicely linked, took awhile to get for me, but works well by weaving a broad tapestry. This author is new for me, and I would read more of his work now that I have read this one.
