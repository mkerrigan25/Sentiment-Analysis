By John - See all my reviews
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
McCann has some wonderful turns of phrase in this book, and is clearly a master of the English language. Based on the glowing reviews and awards, I perhaps set my expectations too high. The story is a loosely connected series of vignettes of the sleazy underbelly of New York, prostitutes and Irishmen, I suppose, being Irishmen. Oddly the story emphasizes the true story of the man who sky-walked between the twin towers, although one wonders what he has to do with the novel at all. There are extended patches of rather senseless dialogue from those who observed it as if it were the greatest event ever. Are we are really talking about blase New Yorkers? It is almost as if the author thought the event itself was worthy of a novel, but keeps the reason hidden from the reader. The author also constructs, aye, that's the proper word, quite a few convenient connections between people that are so contrived as to be a bit off-putting. Some of the characters are interesting but it really takes a John Irving to make believable connections between a tightrope-walker, a band of prostitutes, and two Irish brothers.

Would I recommend this book to my best friend or book club? Is it dazzling, ground-breaking as claimed? Not really, but I wouldn't discourage any reading addict from having a go at it, since McCann is an excellent writer.
