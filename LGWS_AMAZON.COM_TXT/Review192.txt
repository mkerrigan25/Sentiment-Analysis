This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I kept waiting for the different story lines to be revisited; I wasn't prepared for the multiple vignettes. All along I expected them to connect or be expanded, so I was left wanting more of each. But the pieces combine in a satisfying way in the end.
