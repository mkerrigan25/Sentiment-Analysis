This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The story drew me in immediately and I became very intrigued and invested in the character Corrigan and how he "wanted other people's pain." He had a deep and beautiful soul and I felt his sensuality coming off the pages (even though he is a priest). Then, the book slipped into the next character and the next and for a long time, it felt like the book was not going anywhere. Maybe the story was going, but it was not getting anywhere. Just as I started caring about what was going to happen to Tillie or Claire or Adelita or Gloria, another character stepped in. As a result, midway through, despite the poetic and startlingly beautiful language, I almost put the book down. I felt I was working my way through some interesting short stories but none of them gave me enough of any of the characters. The descriptions are uncanny, they are so perfect, the vignettes are full of interesting people, but the plot meandered. Ultimately, I discovered there really wasn't a plot. It's a very different kind of a book and is full of grief, love, healing and more emotions than I thought possible in one story, but I did feel l was left hanging with the snippets of so many characters' lives starting and stopping. Some of the character's lives intersected, but in a way that left you unsatisfied. In sum, the writing is glorious, the story interesting, but the plot missing.
