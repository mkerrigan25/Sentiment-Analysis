 Enjoyable read but ultimately unsatisfying, May 12, 2011

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback

Let The Great World Spin is a good book, but it ultimately left me somewhat unsatisfied. Like most books that don't follow a single narrative, but rather jump back and forth between characters and plots, it does not provide great character development - just as you get to know a character, you lose them and get a new one. Yes, the stories are all overlapping, but none of them feel quite finished. However, I will say that I very much enjoyed the book for the most part and had trouble putting it down. I can't see myself recommending it to a friend, though, as there are a lot of better books out there. Sorry Mr. McCann!
