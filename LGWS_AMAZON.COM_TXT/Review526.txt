This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
From an interview with Colum McCann in the back of the book, it seems like he's quite a decent fellow, so I'll raise a toast to him. (I've also enjoyed some of his earlier work.) And the characters in this novel are certainly decent also: despite their quirks and weaknesses, it's hard not to root for every one of them. But I'm afraid that my best wishes for both the author and his characters don't help my response to the book itself--which is, to put it simply, that I found it boring. I honestly had to work and work to finish this novel. I won't rehearse the plot of the book since you can find it in other reviews, but I think the conception (imagining the day of Philippe Petit's walk between the towers) was fantastic. The characters, as noted above, cry out for our sympathy. The ending is sweet. But somehow the whole piece, the way it tries to show the "two degrees of separation" that hold together a city, never holds together itself. In trying to manipulate the characters and their relationships through the complexity of their lives and this particular day, the novel feels more arranged than heartfelt: characters seem to have functions in a plot rather than lives in our imaginations. Scenes end up sounding like "set pieces," where the prose sounds self-involved and the characters consequently artificial. Some tumble into stereotypes, and others seem less than complete (e.g., one character is said to belong to a religious organization simply referred to as the "Order," as if this were a Dan Brown novel. Religious orders have particular names and identities, even if imaginary ones, so why not fill us in on this?). The shadow of the Twin Towers haunts this book, but the poignancy of this real event isn't enough to sustain a poignancy in the book's imagined ones.
