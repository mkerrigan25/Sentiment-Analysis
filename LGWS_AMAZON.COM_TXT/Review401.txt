This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book contains sections about several different groups of people, none of whom seem to have a connection to each other. It is like reading a book of short stories, which is NOT my cup of tea. I have been told that they all come together in the end, but I didn't get that far. I didn't find a reason to care about any of them.
