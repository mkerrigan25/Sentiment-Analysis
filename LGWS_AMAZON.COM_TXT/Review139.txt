This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
It has been a long time since I gasped when reading a book - try not to at the end of the first chapter. New York in the 1970s is presented, warts and all, by characters who interconnect in ways you will never guess. Amazing job by the author, and, regardless of whether it is made into a movie (I hear it is), this is a book that should be read - it will bring you smiles and tears.
