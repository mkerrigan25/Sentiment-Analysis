This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
My book club's selection, "Let the Great World Spin", promised to live up to its reviews and awards. I found it a muddle of language with long paragraphs of description (one paragraph that took up half a page consisted entirely of phrases that began "Death by....") Some of the characters were appealing, others shallow in both their development and world view. They all seemed to be haunted by voices from the past--the Park Avenue matron whose grief over her only son's death was poignant but bogged down in detail--petunias, bagels, ashtrays, mezuzzahs, cigarettes). (This writer should take a page from Hemingway and McCarthy and go for the pithy but succinct simple sentence.)

The writer's idiosyncratic use of punctuation and sentence structure seemed, after a point, just laziness. The book didn't hold my attention for more than 10 minutes at a time. After ten minutes, I put it down, annoyed with the lack of continuity and inadequate character development.

I've never been enamored of the glamor and grittiness of New York City. I'm even less impressed now. McCann seems better at describing Dublin where we get a definite sense of place and culture. Lately, I've been 0 for 4 when it comes to new writers. I hope my choices improve.
