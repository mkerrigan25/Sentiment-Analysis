This book was a bit slow to start and I struggled to get through the first chapter. There is a lot of character development that first chapter, about half way through I was hooked. Just when you get hooked into a chapter he changes the narrator on you, which makes you want to keep reading. The writing in this book was beautiful, seriously some of the best I have read in a while. The story is set in NYC in the early 70's circulating around the event of Philippe Petit tightrope walking across the twin towers. Many of the characters are connected and in the end it really all comes together. The ending of the book was truly beautiful, poetic, I was sad the story ended and could not stop thinking about the last few paragraphs.
