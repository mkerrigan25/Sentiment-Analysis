This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This is less a novel and more a series of interconnected vignettes about the lives of New York City residents on the day in 1974 when a daredevil walked a tightrope between the two towers of The World Trade Center.

Actually, there is distressingly little about the tightrope walk, which was an interesting and exciting historical event. Instead, all the stories revolve around a disillusioned Irish priest, John Corrigan, and all the characters are being eaten by soul-destroying pain of one form or another.

I'm of two minds about this book. While I admire McCann's writing skills and found some real gems in the prose, I could never get into the book and had to force myself to finish. Really depressing - I'm surprised Oprah hasn't picked this one.
