This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback 

When I heard that this book won the National Book Award, I cheered. "Let the Great World Spin" is deserving. It respects language. It honors story. It finds beauty in the smallest of moments that seem anything but beautiful at first glance. It drew me in just as Philippe Petit, the inspiration for this book, drew people in with his tightrope walk between the Twin Towers. I had to read on. I had to see how it would be done. It rivals for originality my other two favorites this year---"Dead Boys" and "Winter's Tale."
