This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
This is not the typical book for me. I usually go for the Victorian age or older. However, I decided to give this book a chance due to the awards and excellent reviews. I became very interested in the tightrope walker (Philippe Petit) and went on to watch the documentary on the man and his crazy plan.

This book only spends a little time on the whole tightrope walker episode. Most of the time you are learning about a complex group of characters trying to survive tough times in New York's worst neighborhoods. The choices they make and the lives they live are not preferred, wanted, or what we typically call normal. However, they are struggling as best they can.

Reading this book is a bit painful. The situations described, the decisions the characters make are very real. It is almost as if this were a documentary. The more you learn about each character, the more you want to know. The writing it very good and the characters are deep, wide, and believable.

Pros:
o excellent character building
o the interweaving of multiple story lines and the final climax is very good
o setting descriptions take you back with ease to 1970s New York

Cons:
o somewhat of a tough read - bad things happen and you really don't want them to

Overall - I highly recommend this book. It is so well written, the character are so believable. I was thinking about it for weeks after finishing it.
