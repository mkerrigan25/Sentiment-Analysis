This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I don't agree this is brilliant or best ever as I've read here. I'll voice my opinion but note I'm prejudiced because he teaches where I also used to teach (different department -- never met him).
The book feels like a collection of short stories that were tweaked until they became a bunch of short stories loosely held together. One can pretty much identify the parts that appear added to link them.

I liked much of the writing, in parts it flew, in parts it seemed a bit contrived. McCann certainly does not possess the Tolstoy-an espertise for knowing just how long to make a section. Most of the characters end up speaking about the same as one another with a few different words but a pacing and line length that blends into one voice, that of the author. One chapter and voice is different because it starts out slangily but then it shifts in and out of the slang as the chapter continues.

It's not bad at all, but it's not really great either. It is a mildly amusing plodding along story. The design of the plot of stories all centering around the wire walk is really wonderful. Overall though about half the stories strike a daring balance on the high wire, the other ones...well don't look down.
