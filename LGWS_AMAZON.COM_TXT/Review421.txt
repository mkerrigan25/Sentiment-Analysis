This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Several short stories are set against the backdrop of Philipe Petite, the man who did a tightrope walk between the World Trade Center Towers. The protagonists of McCann's stories seemed to teeter totter and mostly fall, as Petite gracefully accomplished his mission.
McCann is a skillful writer who makes you care deeply about people who live on the fringes of society. However, I would have preferred less vignettes and more depth.
