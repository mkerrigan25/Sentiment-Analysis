This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
READ THIS BOOK TWICE IN PREPARATION FOR A BOOK CLUB DISCUSSION; ENJOYED IT EVEN MORE THE 2ND TIME AROUND. MCCAN'S CHARACTER DEPICTIONS ARE SENSITIVE AND BUBBLING IN INTENSITY AND TRUTH. IN THE MIDST OF SQUALLER AND GRIEF THERE IS STILL HOPE, THERE IS STILL THE RISK TO REACH OUT AND LIVE LIFE, TO REACH FOR AND MOUNT THE WIRE. INSPIRATIONAL.
