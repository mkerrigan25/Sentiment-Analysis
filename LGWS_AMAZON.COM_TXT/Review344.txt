 Faces of New York, November 12, 2011
By Rachel (Montreal)
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
The main character in Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin isn't a person but a city. From a book I read several months ago, what still stands out to me is the great New York City of the 1970s. She is a complex character: an unbearably dirty drug-ridden Bronx neighbourhood, given a ray of hope by a young Irish monk who shares coffee and a decent bathroom with the prostitutes who work the streets; a seemingly shallow rich Upper East Side that has been just as devastated by the Vietnam War as anywhere else; a teenage subculture of tagging the hardest-to-reach spots of subway tunnels. And all of this brought together, holding its breath, as a French tightrope walker prances his way, a quarter of a mile high, between the World Trade Towers. I am left with a sad yet warm feeling that alongside war and poverty there will also always be love and art. Overall, a very good read.
