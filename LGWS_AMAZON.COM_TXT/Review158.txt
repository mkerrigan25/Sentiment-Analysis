This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
One of the most humane, inventive, and well-written American novels that I have read in a long time. McCann's uncanny ability to create distinct and believable voices sets this novel apart from many other post-9/11 novels. Those who appreciate the New York of Don DeLillo's novels will be pleased to discover it again, in McCann's novel, which takes place in the early 1970s before concluding in the late 2000's. While not as sweeping in scope as DeLillo's 'Underworld,' 'Let the Great World Spin' seamlessly blends historical events and place into a fictional narrative that meditates on the lives touched, and those ignored in the shadows of, the newly constructed Twin Towers.
