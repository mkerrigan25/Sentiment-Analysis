This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I was so afraid I would be disappointed by this book, but instead I have been pleasantly surprized and joyfully look forward each day to coming back to it at night. A truly masterful work. Several lines, themes, families, metaphoric fields, masterfully interwoven in a story that shines as it reaches toward ever higher aspirations. The author is solidly in control throughout the novel and displays an astonishing ability to portray an array of disparate "voices" without ever a discordant note. Haven't finished it yet; will regret having done so when I get there. Wish it could go on and on.
