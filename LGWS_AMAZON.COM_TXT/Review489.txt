This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Let the Great World Spin is a collection of short stories ostensibly tied together by the character's connection to the act of a funambulist, who walked between the twin towers of the world trade center in 1974. However, the characters are actually tied together by a sort of extended family tree portrait that paints a picture of the origins of the life of a particular young woman.

Was the writing uneven and lacking focus at times? Yes. However, I don't think that that distracts from the book at all. Life is like that. This book is about life. If it were consistent, driving, thrilling from page to page, then it wouldn't be as compelling.

I tend to rate books by whether or not I though my time was well spent, and worth the few dollars I spent to read it. In this case, I feel that I was more than amply rewarded by the experience. There were slow points, but it was never a struggle. When the writing was good, it was brilliant. When I was done, I was glad to have read it.

Finally, a warning for sensitive readers. I enjoyed the book a great deal, but this is not a book you should read if you have objections to reading about prostitutes, pimps, drug users and fornicators. On the other hand, if you're looking for some salacious reading - you're not going to find that here either :) It's just about stuff that happens - interesting stuff - but just stuff.
