 THIS BOOK!! IS A MUST READ, March 5, 2012

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
Although I had read reviews on this book and it has been on my read list for sometime; I was NO WAY prepared for the impact the characters and stories touched my heart & soul. I read ALOT and this book reminded me that most of what I read and enjoy has been almost a waste of my time compared to this novel. This story revolves around Philipe Petit's high wire walk between the world trade centers that took place in the 1970's--another thing I loved about the book..the time & place. I cannot praise it enough. I was moved to tears more than once as I read & there are quotes from this book in my journal...words I never want to forget.
