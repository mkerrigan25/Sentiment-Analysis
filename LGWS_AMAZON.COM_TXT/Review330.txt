This review is from: Let the Great World Spin kindle edition
Let the Great World Spin is one of my all time favorite books.
McCann has a way of drawing the reader in, and you don't want to leave.
I remember the day that Philipe Petit walked across the wire, and I love the way
events in the story were woven around on that day, bringing it all together.
Beautiful writing!
Terrific story!
