This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Do you want to have an idea of how was 70's? More precisely, do you want to have a minimal clue of how was living in New York during the 70's?

If the answer is YES for one of the questions above, try another book. This one is great in its emptiness on describing both of them - the time when and the city where the poor characters lived their role.

And if you are looking for at least good stories, find out another book. The stories in this book have always something in common - they are slushy.

But the book has one great value - it makes you feel that if this one deserved the National Book Award, you can try to be a great writer. Even if you are a foreigner, like me.
