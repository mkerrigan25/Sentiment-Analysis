This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This book was amazing! It was a little slow to start, but I finished it knowing that it was a book that changed my life. It tells different stories of people who at the same moment the infamous tight rope walker was making his way over New York City between the Twin Towers in the 1970's, were going about everyday life. Wonderful stories!
