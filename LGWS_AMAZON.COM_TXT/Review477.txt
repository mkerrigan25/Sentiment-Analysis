This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I purchased this book based on a recommendation, and I suggest you do the same. Each character is so completely realized, by the end of the book you feel as if you've known them your entire life. I did not want it to end, but when it did, I was overwhelmingly satisfied with the result. A full meal, for sure.
