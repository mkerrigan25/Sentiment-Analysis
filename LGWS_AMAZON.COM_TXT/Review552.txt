This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Im pretty sure that this will go down as one of the most over-rated books this past year. After reading one dazzling review after another i went out and got this book, eager to read the next contemporary masterpiece. While it is written well it's just one of those books that you end up not caring at all about anyone in it or what happens to them. Everything is dry, drawn out and unsatisfying. I tried hard to like this book but it just never happened for me.
