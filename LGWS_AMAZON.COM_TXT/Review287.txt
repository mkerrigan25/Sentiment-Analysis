This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
When our book group chose this book it was completely unknown by most of us. What a find. The story, especially for those old enough to remember that time frame, is compelling and the characters fascinating. The first section was a little tough for some people to get through, but it's worth slogging through the first bit until it begins to come clear how it all hangs together by unexpected cords that prove as strong as a tightrope walker's cords.
