This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I am not going to say much. I rarely rate books, or anything for that matter on Amazon. However I found this novel to be such a great read that I wanted to encourage others to buy it or go to the library and check it out. This author has an amazing talent for writing from the perspectives of multiple characters and really capturing each person's own unique emotions. Thanks Mr. McCann.
