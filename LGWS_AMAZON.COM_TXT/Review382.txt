This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback

I've said for some time now, which is truly a reflection on my own aging process, that I find literary novels to be a waste of time. They are not relevant to the world, there is nothing propelling the plot along, they are, simply, great character pieces with, if you're lucky, sometimes great writing. Colum McCann can write and he does it well here. But this book seems more like a writing class assignment than anything else. I give him credit for taking ten or so different characters and giving them not only their own voice but their own distinctive writing style. And like most literary novelists, he leaves no stone unturned, letting us the reader know everything about these individual characters. Unfortunately, that does not make for a good read. So, not only is there nothing moving this book along, not only is there not a central beloved character in the absence of a central plot, but the book has both no relevance to the world today, because it's set in the '70's, nor to itself. The characters have the thinnest of connections to each other and barely share the same overriding background: the highwire tightrope from one twin tower to the other by Philippe Petit. Somebody just asked me if I recommended this book, and I had to tell them no. McCann gets a 5 for writing, but a 1 for plot.
