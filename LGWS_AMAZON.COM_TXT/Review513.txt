This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This may be the best book of the year (for me) so far. Centered in New York city and the days surrounding the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center towers by Philippe Petit in August, 1974, McCann weaves a moving tale of people whose lives intersect in interesting ways.

There is Corrigan, a monk who provides creature comforts and a place to pee for the local whores, and his brother Ciaran, horrified by his brother's ministrations and circumstances until he sees beyond his initial impressions. There are the 'fallen women' too, Jazzlyn and her mother Tillie, both on the stroll but dreaming of anything better. Miles uptown, Claire Soderberg and her judge husband, Solomon, are still reeling from the death of their son in Vietnam. Claire meets with a group of other mothers who have suffered the same loss, but this is the first time she's hosting the meeting in her Park Avenue penthouse, and she fears rejection by the less rich group. Gloria, the only black member of the mothers group, discovers something new as well, about herself and others. Judge Soderberg surrounds himself in work and rituals, finding it hard to talk about his loss, even with Claire. And high above them all, the wire walker stuns and uplifts his watchers, and all of the characters find some connection to the idea of the man on the wire.

The writing is gorgeous, the chapters gracefully weave one character's narrative into another's. There is great sadness, but there are moments of humor and kindness, and always, compassion. I loved the characters and the story and setting. I can't summarize the wide-reaching plot, because it's not strictly linear and so beautifully compressed, and better experienced by the immersion of the reader. Well worth anyone's time.
