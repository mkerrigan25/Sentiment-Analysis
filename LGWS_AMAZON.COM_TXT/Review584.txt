This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This book left me breathless. Spot on descriptions of hookers and priests under our dearly missed trade towers stayed with me thru eggnog, church, and mean relative's whining at Cmas. A delight and joy to have met the characters.
