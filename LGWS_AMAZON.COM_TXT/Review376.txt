This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
After hearing many people tell me this book was wonderful I decided to read it (in paperback, not with a kIndle). The book appears long but believe it or not the author really allows his words to flow and the book moves fast and with an interesting interlocking of the characters. Although everything on the ground is mostly fiction, his ability to weave these personal stories into the action above the ground at the famous Trade Center Towers was wonderful.
