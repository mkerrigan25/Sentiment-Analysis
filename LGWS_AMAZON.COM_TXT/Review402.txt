This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I liked the book. Then after reading 349 pages of good writing, I made the mistake of reading the authors notes. These 4 pages knocked me off my tightrope and ruined the book for me. It would have been better for he author to keep his blatant political leanings from an otherwise decent read.
