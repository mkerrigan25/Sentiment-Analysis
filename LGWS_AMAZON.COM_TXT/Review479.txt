This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I'll start by saying, I've written a book. It's unpublished, I don't know what steps to take in order to get it published, and myself, and anyone who has read it love the weight of my book, it's not a game changer, just a good story. Then I read a book such as this, "Let The Great World Spin" is a humbling beautiful reminder of what story telling should be, the language it should be told in, and how things are supposed to be done when and if done right. A style of writing that isn't so much new, and isn't so much old. It fits right in between, right in between Amy Hampel and Khalid Hossieni. And in there, it finds it's own style, a style that writers that are better than me and worse than me will attempt to copy. Some of us will achieve it, some of us will deny that were striving for it, but in a way every single one of us will fail, no matter how far from the acorn tree we fall. Every detail, fits perfect, like your in the room with someone that just told you that they're cheating on you, but instead of scream and cry, no notice that they have freckle's on their nose, and that the clock is different than your watch's time. Then it hits you, then you cry. It's moments like that, the real, this is how life truly works whether you notice it or not, moments.

This is the type of author who I hope to never meet, I'd probably say thank you over him saying thank you.
