This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This was a gorgeous portrait of pain and love. The characters were each carefully rendered, memorable and real. I don't really understand the negative reviews. The book certainly had substance but was also very entertaining. Anyone who has suffered and endured can identify with the people in the book.
