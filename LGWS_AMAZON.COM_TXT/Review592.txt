This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I had really high hopes for this one but it did not pay off mid way through I thought about giving up but I pushed through waiting for the choppy disjointed stories to connect & for the light to come on. It didn't. I wish I had packed it in early. I never cared about the characters that I believe were developed poorly & I felt I was reading a collection of short stories and a rough draft of a book that had potential but never put it all together.
