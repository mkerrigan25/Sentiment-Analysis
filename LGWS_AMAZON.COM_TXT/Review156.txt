Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
A look at life in Dublin, the Bronx and Manhattan from the points of view of two brothers - on very different tracks. Very well written. It would actually make an extremely good movie if cast properly and not "hollywooded up".
