This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Perhaps this book is more for people that enjoy "literature" rather than reading for pleasure. I'm also studying another language, so I guess at this point I just want to read a book for the entertainment value. This is not it for me. I made it through the first story which I found inordinately depressing and then quit. Most people seem to think that it was brilliant, so it's probably just a matter of me not being able to appreciate "literature".
