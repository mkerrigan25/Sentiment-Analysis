This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
National Book Award-winning author Colum McCann has just published his 8th book. Let the Great World Spin is his seventh. A fictional work, it has been called the most cathartic of the post-9/11 works of literature. McCann uses skillful and powerful prose to create realistic fictional characters whose lives have all been touched by violence and loss, and whose lives link together in surprising ways. The setting is New York, 1974. The novel is set in motion by a real-life New York happening--a tightrope walker who walks between the World Trade Towers. There's even a haunting photograph, showing the tightrope walker in the foreground, with a plane in the background that appears to be heading right for one of the Tower buildings. But wait! This novel is set more than a quarter century before the carnage of 9/11/2001, which is never mentioned, but that underscores the happenings in this plot. McCann has written a book with memorable fictional characters and realistic dialogue to present ways of dealing with the violence and loss that characterize our times. It is masterful.
