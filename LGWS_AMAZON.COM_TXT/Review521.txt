This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
My sister sent me Let the Great World Spin: A Novel for my birthday and I was unfamiliar with both the author and the book. Having been enthralled with, Man on Wire, the film of Philippe Petit's tightwalking endeavors, I was excited to begin the novel which I assumed would be a straightforward fictional narrative of the public's reaction to Petit's feat of walking on air between New York City's World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974. I was so wrong. Colum McCann opens his novel with Petit's surreptitious and halting act, but in Book One moves to Ireland in the 1950's where we are introduced to a pair of brothers who we follow to NYC. The novel sways to and fro as did Petit on wire, from decade to decade, character to character, until the reader realizes they are all interwoven, characters and events affecting one another throughout the three Books which comprise the novel. Characters are developed, history is revealed, and culture is defined among the ruins of lives, unpredictable liaisons, and outcomes which I personally interpreted as positive in the end. I am not a linear thinker by nature, so I believe that I am the perfect audience for this very intricately commingled story about an assortment of individuals who are not as dissimilar as one would expect. If you're looking for an a-b-c-d format in this tale, you'll likely be disappointed. On the other hand, if you prefer short bursts of complexities which keep your recollection in check, then perhaps you'll savor this book and think it's one of the best you've read in the past year as much as I did.
