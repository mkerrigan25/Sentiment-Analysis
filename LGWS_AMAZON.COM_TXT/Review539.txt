This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
What a fabulous book! If you know Colum McCann's other work, then you know him to be a lyrical, entrancing writer, whose use of language is original and immensely satisfying and whose stories are also original and immensely satisfying. Mr. McCann is Irish, but he writes American stories that could only be written by one has had to observe us, and in doing so come to know us better than we know ourselves. That might sound trite, but when you read the book, you'll know what I mean. Mr. McCann shows an America that gleams, and even when it is corrupt, damaged and in pain, he gives us characters who are alive on the page, multidimensional, people we could know and might even want to. So now comes Let the Great World Spin, a novel about 9/11 that gets its power from when the Towers were still standing and the people affected by another event involving them, when Philippe Petit walked on a tight rope between them in 1972. As the links between the characters are forged, McCann develops a deep bass line that compels us toward our other 9/11 memories. This book is a triumph, deserving all the accolades it has received.
