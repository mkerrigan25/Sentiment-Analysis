I was really excited about this book when I got it. It took me three tries to actually finish it unfortunately. It was woven together like short stories, which was interesting. But on the whole I found it really slow and it didn't grab my attention. There were moments where I thought maybe I was really going to be happy I read it, like a spark of great writing was shining through. But then I was back to sloshing through it. Not my cup of tea...
