This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
He is clearly a great writer, and is excellent at character development. But then just when you're into a character, they're gone. It's so many short vignettes pulled together, and I guess just boils down to personal preference: I enjoy reading more in-depth stories about one or two characters, with a fully developed plot that resolves in the end. This novel left me hanging. I also tend to like very direct, informational sentences. Lots of flowery prose here and sometimes it would seem like an utter stream of consciousness and I'd be left at the end of a few very large paragraphs saying..."huh?" He interweaves the different stories in an interesting way, but it just wasn't a page turner for me.
