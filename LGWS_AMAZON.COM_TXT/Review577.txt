This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
One city. One tightrope walker. A million lives affected, including this one.

Colum McCann's masterful mosaic, "Let the Great World Spin" is a collection of interwoven stories that seemingly are disconnected, but often many, unforced, beautiful connections. An Irishman seeking out his brother the priest, a group of Bronx hookers, an uptown woman mourning her son, a man daring to span two tall buildings, all play significant parts in this story, a story of many, many surprises. Writing from a multi-character perspective, McCann manages to inhabit even the most minor character, expanding it rapidly and creating an immense world of their own, sometimes within a few pages.

As I delved into this book (which isn't necessarily quick nor easy), the complexity of the story, as well as McCann's writing style, appealed. Somehow channeling his Walt Whitman side, McCann's listing and quick descriptions bring to life New York in the 70's, as well as the rich, inner interiors of the characters. It's that rich.

Upon finishing the last page, I so wanted to return to the first, which is a rare feeling for me. But I realized, in my haste to read this book, that I unintentionally ignored some characters, writing them off as minor, but in the end, are major, which, in itself, brings the idea of why do we diminish some characters and raise the profile of others? At any rate, I so want to revisit this book. It's hard, complex, real, and heartbreaking, all at once.
