This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Solidly written. One of those many-intertwined-lives of strangers type stories. Enjoyable read, and while the author gets bogged down with certain writing elements (long lists of random items for sound purposes) overall a very well written novel. Would recommend to anyone looking for an alternative to the trilogy drivel.
