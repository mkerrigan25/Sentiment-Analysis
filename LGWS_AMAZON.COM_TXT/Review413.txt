This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Colum McCann

If you are looking for a `feel good' read, this probably is not the best book choice for you. But if you are looking for a book of depth and perception, that can capture a mood and essence of each character perfectly, I highly recommend Let the Great World Spin. This is NYC of the seventies - a period of Vietnam War unrest, drugs and prostitution - with the World Trade Center Twin Towers looming as a backdrop. Where were you when Philippe Petit made his daring high wire crossing between those two towers?

Let the Great World Spin starts softly, establishing a mood from which all characters emerge. Lives begin to mesh and collide. Events encircle his characters, so fully fleshed that they creep into your psyche while you're not looking. McCann's chapters depict events - at times sordid or disturbing, at times fascinating or outright humorous - yet each in its own way gripping and compelling. McCann's characters come alive through his uncanny ability to literally step inside their heads, with artistry that extends far beyond that of a fine storyteller. This author literally becomes the soul of each character, enveloping and permeating each persona as he translates their underlying emotions and thoughts through conversation, action and interaction.

McCann's adeptness with language enables him to paint landscapes, portraits and events with an artist's eye. Pick up a copy Let the Great World Spin and get ready for a memorable read.
