This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This book suffers from the same flaws as so many of the books I've read lately. Maybe I'm just becoming ultra-critical the more I read, but there was very little in this book that worked for me.

It's so frustrating to hear over and over again that writer's need to show and not tell, only to come across award-winning books that break this cardinal rule. Let the Great World Spin provides a very good example of why it doesn't work: It's extremely tedious to read. Being a fan of 19th century fiction I have a high tolerance for detailed scene setting, subtle nuance and limited action. I don't mind lashings of backstory when it's done properly, but large portions of this book read like a first draft.

I love that the author was trying to portray an iconic event in New York city history from many different perspectives, showing the diversity and also the connections between characters from vastly different backgrounds. He also touches on contemporary issues in the wake of September 11. Unfortunately the characters were flat and stereotypical for me. Flicking from one perspective to the next did not allow me to connect with any of them in a significant way. Despite the detailed descriptions, the portrayal of New York city didn't feel authentic and I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated as I went along. The connections between characters seemed contrived and I got a strong sense that the writer had no real plan for the ending as it just got thinner and thinner and petered out.

There was also a problem with overwriting. This is my favourite example: "The sunset was the color of muscle, pink and striated gray." Another disappointing read for me.
