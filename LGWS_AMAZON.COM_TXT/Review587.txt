This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book is beautifully and brilliant written by Colum McCann. Colum takes you on a journey through a wide variety of interlinked characters in New York City on the day Philippe Petit dares to walk between the Twin Towers.

Colum's goal is to place the reader inside the shoes of people who walk the wire on a daily basis. The reader feels and hears the thoughts of: several different prostitutes who live in poverty and whom cling to each other to survive, a monk who struggles with living out the oath he took and living like Christ in the poverty stricken slums of New York, and a recovering junkie who wants to shed her past lifestyle. All of these characters along with several more, make one day in NYC seem like a lifetime.
