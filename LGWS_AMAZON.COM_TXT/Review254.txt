This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
The depth of emotion in this book is great. It is a lovely look into the interconnected-ness of the world. The way in which people can perceive the same event or people in such different ways. This book is realism and gritty emotion. It's characters are flawed and real and like each of us in this world fighting their own demons and loss not matter what they appear to be on the surface.
