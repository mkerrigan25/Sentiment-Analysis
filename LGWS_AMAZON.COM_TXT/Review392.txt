This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I love Irish Authors and their dramatic writing! This is a tale of two brothers, and their life in America after the death of their mother. One struggles with his Catholic faith all of his life, the other is there in the shadows. the book takes off quickly, and brought me to tears in the beginning. There were unexpected events. It kept me reading!
