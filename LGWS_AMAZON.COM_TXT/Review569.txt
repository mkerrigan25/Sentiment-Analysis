This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I began reading this book while traveling which was a bad idea. There were way too many distractions for me to get into this book. So I started it Monday but didn't finish it until last night. I'm really glad I stuck with it though because I really enjoyed reading it.

The central event of this book is a man walking across a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. I had no idea but this part of the book is true! The other sections of the book, I'm not sure what to call them because they just didn't seem like chapters each were about a different character. It reminded me of Olive Kitteridge: A Novel in Stories by Elizabeth Strout. While I enjoy this style of writing I think it did make it harder for me to get into the story. Once the character's stories started to overlap or I got the story of a character mentioned earlier on then it got interesting.

The characters were very unique and ranged from prostitutes to a rich lady living on Park Avenue. The relationships they shared were amazing and most unexpected. I think my favorite story was A Fear of Love. This was the first part of the book where the stories began to overlap.

Ok that is all I have to say. I'm going to end with a quote from the front matter of the novel because it is prefect.

"All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is."
