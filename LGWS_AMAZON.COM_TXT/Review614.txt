This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I have read thousands of books. I am 50. This book is OK, although I thought early in that it was sub standard, not to my liking.

To give you an idea what I think is high Lit, Le Carre, Hemingway, Scott Turrow, Pat Conroy, Trevanian, Fitzgerald, and a host of others.

This book in my view is scattered, not too interesting, and not very relevant.

Try The girl with the Dragon Tatoo if you want non-stop entertainment.

Sorry to the author, the book is OK but in my eye, nothing special
