This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This is simply an excellent book. I highly recommend it. A touching story, superb writing and an ending that ties up all the loose ends beautifully. I thought it was clever how all the characters have some connection to the tightrope walker, even though they are not directly related.
