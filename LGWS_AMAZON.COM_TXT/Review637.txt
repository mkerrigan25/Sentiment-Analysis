This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I read this book of related short stories (not a novel) to the end bacause I was so sure, given the Amazon editors' rating, that the author would redeem himself and show why he chose to tell these stories out of the multitude of stories that could actually have had some connection to the skywalk. No such luck. I resent the time I gave up to wade through all the showy and showoffy writing (though some of it is genuinely good: just enough to keep you hoping.)

There have been many novels in recent years in which the writing served the story and the setting, novels that challenge and teach in the telling: Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones, The Gift of Rain by Tan Twan Eng, The Solitude of Thomas Cave by Georgina Harding, The Story of Edgar Sawtelle to name just a few. Let the Great World Spin suffers mightily by comparison.
