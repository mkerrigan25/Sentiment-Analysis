This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I'm an avid reader and chose this book because of the rave reviews and honors it has received. This time it didn't pay off. The novel is so tedious I stopped reading after 100 pages. I've heard that the ending of the book makes it worth it - that there is some amazing revelation at the end that ties everything together - but what's the point if you can't get there? I don't recommend this book at all.
