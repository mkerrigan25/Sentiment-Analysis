This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I enjoyed the way the author intertwined the incidents and characters in the setting. It felt like New York...I could picture it though I have spent only a short time there. There is a melancholy expressed......a loneliness but with some hope. The human condition. ....all searching for meaning, purpose, love.
