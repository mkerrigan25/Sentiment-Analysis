This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
If this were a movie rather than a novel, it might look like the unlikely marriage of "Man on a Wire," "Crash," and "I've Loved You for So Long". The characters and their worlds are so compelling, it's as though Colum McCann has pulled out all of the English language's pastels, oils, charcoals, pencils, and watercolors to paint them - and then gently centered his pictures around the pivotal image of a man on a wire. The detail is wonderful - and the style (imagine a more focused, optimistic, male Lonnie Moore) a modern, measured flow of consciousness.

Another thing I loved about this novel is that while it clearly stands as a post-9-11 novel throughout, McCann never once actually mentions "9-11". Even as we become absorbed in another era, McCann's in-the-background focus on the towers holds us in the present. I hope this passage, one of my favorites, will give you a sense of what I'm trying to describe:

"He figured that the tightrope walker must have thought it over
quite a bit beforehand. It wasn't just an offhand walk. He was
making a statement with his body, and if he fell, well, he fell--
but if he survived he would become a monument, not carved in stone
or encased in brass, but one of those New York monuments that made
you say: *Can you believe it?* With an expletive. There would always
be an expletive in a New York sentence."

If I were writing a New York sentence, I'd recommend this novel with an expletive. As it is, I feel I cannot recommend it highly enough.
