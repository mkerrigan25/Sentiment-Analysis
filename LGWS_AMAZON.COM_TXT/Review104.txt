This was our book club selection. At first I found it difficult to connect, but kept reading and found the intertwining of the characters very interesting. For me it was not a page turner, but after finishing it - I would give it a good rating and it is great for book club discussion. Not a beach reading book (my opinion) but more a rainy day book.
