This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The historical event of the tightrope walker is a great metaphor for perilous lives of the people below with everyday challenges/despair, even with their feet on the ground. People need to connect and they try desperately, but in actuality, life appears to be the lonely walk from one end to the other, where walker needs to concentrate on the present step, not the one in the past or the one in the future. Although there are a couple of turns that are predictable, most of the stories of the characters are so beautifully written and very engaging and provoking both emotions and thoughts that the weight of their existence become tangible. I highly recommend this book.
