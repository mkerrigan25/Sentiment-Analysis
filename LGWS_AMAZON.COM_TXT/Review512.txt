This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I purchased this book because of the accolades and wonderful reviews it had received. After finishing the book, I have to admit I'm wondering if I was reading the same book as those that lauded it so highly.

I did like the beginning of the book when it was centered in Ireland, but not long after that I began to lose interest. There was very little intersection of characters throughout the book and what little there was wasn't enough to get me excited.

Yes, there is a bit (just a bit) of a tie-in to some of the more "distant" characters at the end of the book, but it surely wasn't worth the effort to get to that point.

The most touching chapter, in my opinion, was "Centavos"...and it was, by far, the shortest chapter in the book. (If you've decided not to read the book, it's worth going to the bookstore and just reading this chapter. It's a lovely, sentimental and touching remembrance of a just-lost love.)

I hate when a book disappoints like this one did.
