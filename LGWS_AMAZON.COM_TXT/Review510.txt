This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This is a great book about a city. McCann shows us so many of its characters, and he weaves their lives, their heartbreak, their happiness into a single narrative about a place and a people. The main thread of the story is the tight-roping incident, and it works well to hold the book together. I loved the main narratives of the two Irish brothers and mother-daughter pair, but the minor characters intrigued me just as much: the tagger, the judge, the computer programmers. How do you tell the story of a whole city, an entire country, in one book? Colum McCann comes pretty close.
