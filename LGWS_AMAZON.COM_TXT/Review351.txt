 This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback 
This book had such great reviews, and the premise was very interesting, I found I had to give it a try despite enough reviews to the contrary to give me doubt..I should have listened to those reviews.
The story, or stories, is centered around the tightrope walk Phillip Petit completed between the World Trade Center towers in 1974. The novel is constructed as a series of interconnected short stories, some with more connection than others, involving various people in New York that witness the walk, again with varying degrees of involvement. It's a sort of New York Stories meets Six Degrees of Separation, and herein lies part of the problem with the book for me..it has a movie feel to it. Some of the prose is lovely, and some of the stories are interesting, while others are just a chronicle of events and I had little interest in them. Some characters are interesting, the Irish brothers the story begins with, and some are TV/movie cardboard cutouts (the black prostitutes, the uptown women's circle). There was air of pretentiousness in the stories that bothered me throughout the book and ultimately left me disappointed. If you don't want to add insult to injury, don't read the afterward with the author..if I had read that first maybe I would not have bothered with the book at all.
