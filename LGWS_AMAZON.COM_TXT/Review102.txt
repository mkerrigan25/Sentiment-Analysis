This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Beautifully written novel set mainly in New York City depicting the lives of a wide variety of individuals and how they're actions impact one another. From priest to prostitute, judge to tight rope walker, Park Avenue to the projects, this story defines as well as defies stereotypes of several individuals intricately and truthfully portraying their humanism. The story flawlessly weaves together as it jumps to and from the different characters perspectives. Great read!
