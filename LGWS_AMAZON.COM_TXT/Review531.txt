This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Let the Great World Spin is a beautifully written collection of interlocking stories about people whose lives were touched one way or another by an amazing event -- Felippe Petit's famed 1974 tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Halfway through the book, the idea occurred to me that the theme of each story could be described in one word. So here goes:

The Irish monk, Corrigan -- temptation
Claire, who lost a son in the Vietnam war -- grief
The passenger in a hit and run incident -- guilt
The tightrope walker -- determination
The photographer of graffiti tags -- wonder
The computer hackers -- adventure
Tillie, mother of a prostitute -- remorse
Soderberg, the judge who tries the tightrope walker's case -- resignation
Gloria, who has lost three sons in the Vietnam war -- valor
The woman who lost Corrigan -- love
Jaslyn, who lost her mother many years before -- obligation

Sometimes the stories are in first person narrative, other times in third. Either way, each voice is unique and authentic, different than the others. This book is a wonderful read. I highly recommend it.
