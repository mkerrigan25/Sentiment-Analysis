McCann does an incredible job of reaching into the souls of the main characters, two brothers from Ireland, who get involved with New York Cities most debased citizens, the street walkers of the Bronx. He created a rare hybrid in modern literature- poetic prose driven by an exciting narrative. The only false note was a plot point where dry oil paintings left out in the rain run. Any artist knows oil or even acrylic is not water soluble when dry. He should have done his homework.
