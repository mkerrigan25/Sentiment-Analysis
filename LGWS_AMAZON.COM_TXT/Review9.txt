A fabulous read. I couldn't put it down. And so poetically written. I found myself re-reading sentences again and again they were so beautifully written. Warning, though, the plot sort of conks out at the end....nevertheless, it's a fabulous book whose characters stayed with me long after I put the book to rest. Highly recommend it.
