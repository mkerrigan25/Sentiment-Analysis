This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
When you read, McCann's description of Petit's tightrope walk, you are so impressed and involved with the walk as Petit saw it...an art, NOT a circus trick. McCann's descriptions of the preparation for the event, the event itself, and Petit's feelings in the aftermath... are also art, using words instead of physical agility.
This is one of those rare books with great characters, a mesmerizing story, BUT mostly gorgeous writing.
