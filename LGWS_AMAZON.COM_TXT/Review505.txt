This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Reading 'Make the Great World Spin' was not a good or bad experience, it was just fine. There were some good passages, but overall I found it lacking, often flipping to the back of the back of the book to see how many pages I had left to read. I found it to be predictable, though very well suited for a big screen adaptation, which I'm sure will be coming soon. Perhaps my expectations for this book were too high after reading multiple grand reviews, I was hoping for the next 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close', but instead found a fully capably writer handling powerful subject matter with delicate care and delivering a "safe" story.
