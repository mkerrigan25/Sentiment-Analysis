This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This book exceeded all my expectations -- great storytelling, interesting characters, and third act that wraps the story up well without being overdone or cliche. Each chapter is told by a different character, seemingly unrelated to the others, but eventually all the interconnections come to the surface. Each revelation was a genuine surprise to me and I was delighted to see some characters cross over into the others' lives.

I started reading this book on a plane and for the first time ever, I didn't want the flight to end because I wanted to keep reading.
