This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This is one of the most satisfying books I have read in a long time. It is beautifully written and weaves together the stories and struggles of fascinating individuals from different walks of life in NY city. The setting of NY city during the time of Petit Phillipe's tightrope walk between the twin towers adds to the magic.
