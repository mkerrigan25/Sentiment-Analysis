This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The concept is terrific -- capture New York City in the 1970's by detailing the lives of different city-dwellers on the day of Philippe Petit's performance between the World Trade Center towers and the way those lives intertwine. Unfortunately, in my judgment the book did not come close to living up to its ambition. Its setting in the New York of the 1970's is a matter of convenience and literary device--so that crime, the art/drug scene, and the Vietnam War can be discussed--but the book gives you no true feel for that era, much less Petit's feat. You will get much more of both the former and the latter from the extraordinary documentary Man on Wire. As for the short stories of the lives of the different characters, I found them generally stilted and artificial. It starts with a traditional Irish-suffering story which at least rang true, if not fresh. From there, the author attempts to inhabit the minds of prostitutes, young artists, a criminal court judge, four-star mothers of various backgrounds, and so on. The voices are simply not nearly real enough to pull it off. Like a soap opera attempting heft. Not terrible, by any means, but it will not stay with me, and I was eager to be done while only half way through. I would skip this one.
