This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Through masterful storytelling, the author of Let the Great World Spin (he's Irish of course) demonstrates how people's lives can be transformed by a singular event, which can then be a catalyst for deeper connections and life changing attitudes towards oneself and others. The event is a tightrope walk between the twin towers, a feat that captures the imagination of the entire city and hovers above the stories of the disparate people brought together by what becomes a symbolic event, foreshadowing 9/11. The book was written after that event, but pre-Anthony Weiner, and takes place mainly before it in the turbulent times of Nixon's sinking presidency.

The author skips from main character to main character, each of whom recounts his or her story in an individual voice. The threads created are wrapped up at the end in an insightful manner, consistent with each character's persona and the inevitability of life.

Could this be nominated as the definitive 9/11 book? Certainly it could be argued that 9/11 is a theme. Without the portent of the twin towers attack the tightrope walking event would not have the same impact. One senses the significance of the walk as a metaphor or perhaps a potential agent of change in the way people interconnect or are drawn together for good or bad by an external event. The literary quality of this novel would be diminished without the walk and its inherent present day associations,

My take: people drift in and out of your life, affecting you and others in different ways, some profoundly and others fleetingly. You won't notice the interconnectedness until the end, and ever the world spins as we step on and off.
