This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I hate this book and those boring Irish brothers. The author was trying way too hard to create eccentric characters but I found the whole thing to be totally ridiculous and the characters to be so annoying I never want to encounter any of them again. I wanted to stop out of the gate but there were so many great reviews I persevered assuming I was missing something that would soon reveal itself. I know that "persevere" seems like a strong word to use given I only made it to page 55 but it took sheer will to do so - then I set it aside hoping to gain the strength for a second round but that's not going to happen. Dave Eggers, whose writing I respect, gives a glowing review on the cover of Let The Great World Spin. How is it possible? I've considered never buying another Eggers book on principle. This is among the worst books I've ever almost read.
