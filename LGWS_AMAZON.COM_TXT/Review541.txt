This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Looking to heal the great trauma and loss associated with September 11th, 2001 as well as weather the massive survivor guilt, Colum McCann crafts this wonderful fictional tale of rich, disparate and seemingly disconnected characters. Gradually the characters lives move together and become interrelated. This book, for me, was a powerful and transformative experience. I came to love and appreciate all of the characters but my favorite was definitely Gloria. Not surprising, since I believe that relationships and simple acts of love and kindness can save and transform the world. I highly recommend this wonderful book, but suggest reading and savoring it slowly.
