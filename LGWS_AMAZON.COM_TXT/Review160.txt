This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Kindle Edition)
What a fascinating array of characters. The interweaving of the narrative; all linking back to the "real live guy" who really did walk between the world trade building is stunning in it's imagination. It is a truly compelling read that I would not hesitate to recommend to lovers of good literature.
