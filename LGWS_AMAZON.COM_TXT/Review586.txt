This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The rapturous praise that has been heaped on "Let the Great World Spin" puzzles me. It is a good book, a very good book, but the best of 2009? I disagree.
The totality of a great novel should exceed the sum of its parts. For me this book fell short of that standard. Somehow it was structurally hollow at its core. A series of vignettes, each exquistely depicted and remarkable in its own right, but collectively failing to deliver a seismic impact. McCann, like Philip Petit, the tightrope walker who inspired the novel, struts his stuff high in the air. His writing is beautiful: it demonstrates abundant skill and sensitivity. It enthralls. But strangely the totality fails to deliver an overarching emotional or intellectual impact. In the final chapter McCann attempts to tie together all that has come before and provide it with current relevance but, jarring and ineffective, it doesn't work.
A very good book. But the best of 2009? If it had been set in Cleveland and didn't implicate the World Trade Center would it have merited that plaudit? I have my doubts.
