This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The Bridge at San Luis Rey meets Ulysses. Irish angst designed to twist your guts, but for me the slog was not worth it. Too many words...wow!, way too many. The message is worth the telling, the author has talent, but he needs a good sharp razor.
