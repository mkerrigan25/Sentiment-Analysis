This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book was for my boyfriend for christmas, who is an avid reader. His opinion of the book was that with all the different story lines it was a little confusing, and it took until over half of the book for him to get that into it and be interested in finishing it. I will read it soon and maybe give my opinion at a later date...
