This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
NYT reviewer Jonathan Mahler called Let the Great World Spin "...electric and profound." I can't think of adjectives better at describing this wonderful book. How refreshing it is to read really good writing, literature if you will, that is both exciting and meaningful, a book in which the author ensnares you before you are really aware that you're caught in his fictional lair. To then add an emotional wallop to it, is an act of creative excellence that left me heartbroken, but not depressed (again borrowing adjectives from reviewer Mahler). While the situs of the book is NYC in the mid-1970s, and while many call it a book that captures the soul of the city, ultimately it is about people and their underlying stories which could occur anywhere in the world. Yes, the book is about love, loss, grief, and the unpredictability of life, but it also about living through it all and not just coping, but coping well, and in that sense it is uplifting.
