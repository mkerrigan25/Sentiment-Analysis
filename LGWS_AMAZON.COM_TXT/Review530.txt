This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book was assigned for our most recent Book Club. I was looking forward to reading it and started in a most positive frame of mind; but I found it boring and annoying and got tired. Of this kind. Of writing. With details. And more details. That may. Or may not. Be appropriate. Or relevant. For the story

I checked the Amazon reviews to see if ANYONE shared my opinion -- and was glad to discover that a few did.
