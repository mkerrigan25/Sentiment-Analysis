This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
An excellent novel...engrossing, vividly written, lyrical, and ambitious...captures the experience of living in New York from the perspectives of several characters who turn out to have unseen connections to one another. The characters are unique and interesting, and the language throughout the book is very striking. I didn't want it to end.
