This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This interconnected collection of desperate New Yorkers in the seventies, revolve around the astounding tight rope walking of Phillippe Petit between the twin towers. This becomes the catalyst or tipping point for an event that happens and the outward ripple effects among these people. I'll admit, at first, I found myself impressed with McCann's writing, but the book hadn't grabbed me yet, and then the second half took hold and I literally finished the book with tears running down my face. Be patient, it pays off in spades. Wonderful book,
