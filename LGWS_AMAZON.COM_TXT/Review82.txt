This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Embrace this tale's title and you're "gone"--If the world is great, and I believe it is, then let it spin. If you enjoy reading, as less a challenge and more a journey, then let it spin. Sit back and enjoy the ride. Characters. Plot. Action. Attraction. Sensible or not, life is weird and why spend time in 'paralysis through analysis?' Let it spin. It's OK to enjoy, it's OK to sit back and let someone else take the wheel and just go along for the ride...right? "Let the Great World Spin" is a glorious 'ride' with McCann at the wheel.
