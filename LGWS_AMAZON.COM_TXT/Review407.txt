This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I really wanted to like this book. However, every night that I laid down to read it before bed, I felt this dread! Although I graduated from college 16 years ago, every time I would pick up this book, it reminded me of boring things I HAD to read in college. I think the idea of the book is terrific...how all these events eventually come together, but I just couldn't relate to the characters. I didn't care what happened to them. By the 2nd chapter, I wanted to throw the book across the room! The only thing that made me happy about the book is that I didn't purchase it...I borrowed it from a friend. And I will happily return it to her tomorrow!
