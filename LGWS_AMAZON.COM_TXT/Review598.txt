This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Every time I stopped in at Amazon, this book was recommended. I took a look at the reviews and thought, okay, I'll take a chance and read it. Why not! Unfortunately, this book has left me anything but wowed. McCann's stories (as they are a series of short interconnected stories) are not a great read! It felt as if some of the prose, some of the descriptions were for their own sake only, and that somehow the author forgot he was writing for a reader, an audience. We run across these types. They are acclaimed by critics and academia, but when it comes to the true art of story telling and moving the "common" reader, they fall short.
These are not stories that moved me. I never felt connected to the characters or the stories. They never moved me and I never was able to internalize the story(ies). Let me know more about Jazzlyn, Let me know more about Corrigan, his brother and Adelita and their relationships. We have only skimmed the surface. Solomon, Claire, Jacob...why should I care about them? Where is the connection between character and reader? And the tight rope walker...????????

The book falls short and is more an exercise in creative writing than a story(ies)
