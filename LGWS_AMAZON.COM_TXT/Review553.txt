This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I'd never read this author, but the premise of the story sounded interesting, so I gave it a try. I fell in love with his style and characters. I found myself limiting my reading time towards the end, so it wouldn't be over. Definitely one of the best books I've read in a while. Now I'm looking forward to reading his others.
