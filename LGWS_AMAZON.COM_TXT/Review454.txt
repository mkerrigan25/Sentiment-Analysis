...otherwise more precious time would have been wasted on this book. Whoever told you to read this is only attempting to return the favor in some kind of satanic "pay it forward" scheme that answers only to the misery loves company mantra. The only other possible explanation is that all positive reviewers here and elsewhere lead such miserable or mundane lives in their chosen metropoli that reading this book improves their self esteem.
