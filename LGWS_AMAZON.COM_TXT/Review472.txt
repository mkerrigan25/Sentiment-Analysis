This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This novel was remarkable in so many ways. The authors passionate development of each character was as inspiring as his style of describing New York was breathtaking. Mr. McCann is an astounding talent and I look forward to reading everything he has or will pen. Heartbreaking and uplifting in the same breath...I enjoyed every minute of this book. It lingers with you and informs your sensibilities having read it. Thank you Mr. McCann!!!
