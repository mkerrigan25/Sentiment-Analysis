By Jill Dempsey - See all my reviews
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
We all know the expression, "Don't judge a book by its cover," but the cover is specifically why I decided to pick this book up in the first place. I read this novel as an assignment in my high school senior English literature class when my teacher instructed us to read a book that "jumped out at us." When I saw the man on a tightrope above a city, I was intrigued.
Let the Great World Spin is one of my favorite books for several reasons. The way it is written is highly engaging. McCann leaves the readers hanging in suspense on countless occasions - much like the man on the tightrope - with dangerous moves and twists and turns. It also adopts quite a few different points of view from many of the characters that play important roles, and even perspectives of some of the more minor characters. I felt this style of writing was very unique from what I was used to reading, and I found it almost refreshing as a change of pace from some of the more mundane works.
I have recommended this novel to friends in the past and everyone who has read it has very much enjoyed it. I myself have read it twice and writing this review makes me want to read it again. I strongly suggest that you read this book; I love it and I want others to enjoy it as much as I have.
