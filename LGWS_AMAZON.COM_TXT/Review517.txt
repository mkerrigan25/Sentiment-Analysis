This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I would recommend this book only for its middle section which is genius... but the trouble is that you need to read the rest of the book to fully comprehend its power.
The book is made of several stories intertwined, the focal point of which being Philippe Petit's walk on a wire between the 2 WTC towers in 1974.
It's another story about NY, a story about 9/11 (even if not mentioned, you can't escape thinking of it).
The wire journey is only 10-15 pages but is the most striking part of it (I discovered I could still get sweaty hands turning pages of a book), the other 400-some pages giving you a feeling of deja vu (there's so many other excellent, better , books about NY, about the past 30-40 years of western civilization out there), a very good deja vu but one nonetheless.
It's fast, stylish (a diet version of de Lillo ), easy to read, full of political correctness (I gotta say I'm pretty insensitive when it comes to reflexions on priesthood and their actions, whatever they might be) it's got all it needs to be a contemporary classic....but a classic, that'd be a long discussion. Guess we're still waiting for THE book about 9/11 (or is it already out there). In the meantime, I guess this one is not a bad place to start reading about it.
NB : get the "man on wire" DVD and watch it while reading ; on top of being a 5 stars documentary, it gives the book's climax a boost and, well...who would say no to that kind of feeling
