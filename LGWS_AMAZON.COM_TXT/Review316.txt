This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
This was one of the worst books I have ever read. It came across as a creative writing assignment rather than a finished, polished novel. I was shocked to see Frank McCourt had given a blurb for this. The characters are loose and unrelated, and yet somehow the author has tried to tie these together as if it is a compelling story. The first part of the story seems like the one the author wanted to write, but it's like he gave up and couldn't get more out of the characters, so he made up a few random stories and tied them together. If this book did have a purpose, it's lost on the reader. Save your money and skip this one.
