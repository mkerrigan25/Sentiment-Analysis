This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I loved this book. I loved the development of the individual characters and the way the author wove their stories together to make the whole. The ordinary people of the book had a lot more to their lives than appearances would have it. the writing is first quality in my opinion and I look forward to reading his other books.
