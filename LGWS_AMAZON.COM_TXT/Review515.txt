This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I got this book based on the reviews. I am sad to say that I did not find this book interesting at all. It started out pretty good in Ireland and then just kept going downhill from there. I did not find any of the characters interesting. I read about 1/4 of the book and gave up. I have to say, I read a lot of books and this is the first one I didn't finish. I think this book is way over hyped.
