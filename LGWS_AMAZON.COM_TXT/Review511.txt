This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I asked myself while reading it, having seen the National Book Award finalist tag on the cover, what I was missing. But I wasn't missing anything- fifty pages was enough to know the book is a cliched bore. Writing is average for a published novel. Story itself bland and stale.
