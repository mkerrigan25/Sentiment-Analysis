This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I recently downloaded the audio version of this book to keep me entertained on my commute to and from work. Some of the negative reviews I've read here mention how some of the characters seem one dimensional and are difficult to relate to. I would suggest that the audio version artistically solves this problem. Every chapter is narrated by a different voice actor who comes to embody that character. Some are better than others (the actress who reads "Tillie" is fantastic and believable, but the actor who reads "Ben" is a little hard to envision as a nerdy 18 year old computer hacker). If you're having trouble getting through the print edition and you're someone who enjoys audiobooks, I would say not to give up on this book until you've given the audio version a shot.
