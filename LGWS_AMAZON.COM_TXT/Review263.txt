This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This book started strong but then lost my interest. Too much narration and too little plot. The convention of trying to tie the various stories together through the tight rope walker is over-wrought. Some brilliant moments, just too uneven for me.
