This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
A beautifully constructed tale about human connections though many layers of society. My son, who is currently writing a first novel, is celebrating his 59th birthfay today. I sent him this book for inspiration. Colum McCann is amazingly gifted both as a writer and as a positive spokesperson for hope.
