This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I read this book after I saw a review for it in the paper, then on the news. I enjoyed the concept, but the story got a bot boring. Its basically like the movie "Crash," where there is one central focus, and a bunch of different peoples perspective relating to the focus. Its the 1970's in NYC and there is a tight rope walker between the 2 World Trade Center buildings. This is the focus, but then each chapter tells about what is going on in each characters life. I enjoyed some of the descriptions of NYC in the 70's. I also liked the fact that a lot of times, we forget that we are all somehow intertwined. We know what is going on in our own worlds and we forget that the world doesn't revolve around us. This book shows that. Although everyone has seen or heard about the tight rope walker, we all have different things going on in our lives. Maybe this book will make people a little more compassionate next time someone in the street bumps into them. Maybe there is something going on in their lives, and they weren't just out to bump into you. Again, good concept, i just got a little bored with some of the stories, and frankly couldn't wait to finish it.
