This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A beautifully written book that tells the tale of one day on which many lives entwined. In expertly weaving together several seemingly disjointed stories, it appeals to a wide audience, but particularly to those who want to feel the pulse of New York City in the '70s.
