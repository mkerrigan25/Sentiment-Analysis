This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
"Let The Great World Spin" a novel by Colum McCann.

A story of streetside biography told over a century of faith, passion, war, art and one epic crime.

New York City.

A read that is not so much about where it's going but where it is.

A book that will leave your hands stained with honesty.

One of the best I've read.
