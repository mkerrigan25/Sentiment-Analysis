This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
McCann is a great writer but the structure of this story feels more like linked short stories told out of order than a novel. And each section starts without clear explanation about why the story has suddenly changed. I found that I really wanted to hear more about some characters and didn't feel other sections were needed at all. However underlying this there are great stories of the influence of mothers, the mysteries in chance encounters, the ways we connect and influence each other.
