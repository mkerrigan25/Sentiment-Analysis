This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book nearly destroys one's ability to read run of the mill writing. The writing is brilliant and lyrical. The compelling, wonderful characters are truly amazingly drawn and the plotting is fabulous. The ruminations of the "walker" are poetic! This is a great read.
