This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I love Colm McCann's writing voice, and have witnessed how it has developed over the years. This, in my view, is a beautiful book. The earlier sections held me much more than the later ones, though. I'm not sure what that was about. Did he run out of steam? Still, a fantastic read from a wonderful writer.
