This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
There are a few novels that I have read in my lifetime that I wish I could have been the one to write it. Let the Great World Spin is one of them. The novel stayed with me for weeks after reading it. It is hard not to think of the movie Crash while reading it. I love how the author merges all of the characters in the novel, and a plot element that does not seem important ends up being just as important as all of the others.
