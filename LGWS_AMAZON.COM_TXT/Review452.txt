This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The book promises more than it delivers. The writing excels, the means of organizing the novel is interesting, but implementation suffers. Nevertheless, in this book we meet a major talent. The author's Irish origins promise much in terms of future projects he may undertake.

His mother dies at Dublin Bay, Sandymount when he, Ciaran Corrigan is nineteen and his brother John is seventeen. The father, English accented, puts in an appearance. The house is sold, the father getting half of the proceeds. In NYC John calls Ciaran his very serious brother. By the time Ciaran travels to New York their father, a physicist has died whilst teaching in a university classroom. John has to miss the funeral. John Corrigan lives in the south Bronx.

In another portion of the novel, Joshua's mother, Claire Soderberg, has a support group. One of the women, Marcia, the mother of Mike Jr. sees a tightrope walker at the World trade Center. The other women in the group are Gloria, Janet, and Jacqueline and their deceased boys are Clarence, Pete, and Brandon.

Blaine and Lara, continuing the novel from another geographical and social point, are in a 1927 Pontiac using coke. There is a hit and run involving the couple's vehicle and John Corrigan, his van and his passenger. The accident takes place on the day of Nixon's resignation, (and the feat of Phillipe Petit's wire walk), 8/7/74. Subsequently plot lines enmesh some of the characters in the story. In graphic terms, the novel's design is a pinwheel.
