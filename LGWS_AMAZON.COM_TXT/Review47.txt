This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Having just read 'The Man With The Golden Arm', I have to say the themes are very similar. The hopelessness of the city for many at the bottom is depressing, very depressing. However, there is hope in 'Let the Great World Spin'.

This book is really a collection of short stories. And I love collections of short stories almost always. This is no exception. And, to boot, almost all the stories have connections with others in the collection. Maybe 'Tag' sits by itself, a story of a youth who surreptitiously marks the subway tunnels of New York. Or does it? He could stand as the counter for the skywalker. One in the air, one in the earth.

When I first realized these stories were entwined, around (let's call it a chapter) Chapter 3, I was delighted. And the story grew.

I never knew a man actually walked across the towers! And to tie it into so many lives! Very creative.

Some commentary mentioned Joyce. The only Joycean thing I see here - both authors are Irish!
