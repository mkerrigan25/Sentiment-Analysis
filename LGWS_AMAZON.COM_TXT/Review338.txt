This is one of those books that took a while for me to get into, but once I did, I could not put it down. I did not realize how really good it was until I got to the end and began to think of the interweaving of characters and events. I actually did cry while reading this book.

I finished the book about a year ago and still think about the different stories from time to time now. The writing was excellent and the episodic nature was riveting. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to learn about human nature.
