This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This was an amazing book, especially if you remember Sept 11th and the demise of the Twin Towers in NYC. And, if you've seen the amazing documentary, "Man on Wire", it's even better. In fact, I would suggest renting and watching that movie before reading the book as it will provide a richer context to your read.

The writing captured me from the first page to the last. And, even though it seemed a bit contrived at times, the two degrees of separation between all the characters was actually both intriguing and entertaining. The book is so well-written. There are sentences and paragraphs you want to underline and savor later on their own.

I also found the book to be a fast read because it is so engaging. I've recommended it to several of my friends as I found it a "must read".
