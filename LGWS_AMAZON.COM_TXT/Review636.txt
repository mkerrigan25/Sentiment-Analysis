This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This beautifully written book has stayed with me several weeks after completion; my favorite test of a book is how much I resist the coming end as my little bookmark moves further and further forward. I was captivated by the ability of the author to speak through the characters chapter after chapter, and deftly weaving seamlessly the disjointed lives together. I highly recommend this lovely work for quiet evenings after work, when you want to escape into an entirely different sphere of existence than your own.
