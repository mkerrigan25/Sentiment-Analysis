This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
The book is well woven between different characters during different periods of time. It wonderfully connects the lives of many different types if people (prostitute to priest to judge) and outlines how we may think differently and lead different lives but fundamentally we are all the same (love, laugh, cry)..
