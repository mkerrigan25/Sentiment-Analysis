 Riffing with words falls flat, November 3, 2010

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I am about 2/3 of the way through this book and I don't think I can bring myself to finish it. The author is trying to use words in new ways to convey an impression of what he is describing but the words just don't work as intended. Too many wrong notes are struck.

Any of the sections dealing with computers are complete fantasy and don't lend much authenticity to the rest of his writing. If he can't be bothered to find out about computers than what does he know about painters, war veterans, hookers and priests?
