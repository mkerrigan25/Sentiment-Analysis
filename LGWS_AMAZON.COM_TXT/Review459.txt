This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I loved this book and was sad when it was over. It is cleverly composed and the story line weaves in and out of chapters that at first seem disconnected. I highly recommend it for anyone who is not interested in fluff. This book grabs your heart and makes you think.
