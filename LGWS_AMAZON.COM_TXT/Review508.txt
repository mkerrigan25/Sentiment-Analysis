This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I thought the premise of this book sounded really interesting - how all of the random people are interrelated during this short time period and primarily because of one event. I won't go into too much more detail about the story, because many of the other reviewers have given a good summation of that. However, I will tell you how I felt about the book as I read through it - I found the first two stories very easy to read and enjoy. But then as I continued reading others with new characters it became difficult to really get into all of them. I almost felt like there were just a few too many - you reach a certain point where you want to start seeing them all come together and for me that point came a little too late in the book. Once that began to happen, I started to really enjoy the book again. And after I finished it, I really liked the whole sum of the parts.

We read this for my book club and I can tell you that I think other members felt the same way - when we met many had stopped reading, or hadn't finished due to their frustration. Then after I told them that I liked it a lot more as I got through it, I think they persisted and agreed that it was better after getting closer to the end.

Overall, I think it's brilliant the way the author thought up all of the unique characters and blended them into one story this way, I just thought the middle was a little choppy and difficult to read. Definitely worth reading the entire thing though.
