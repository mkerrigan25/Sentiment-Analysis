This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The book seems overwritten to me, with a lot of extra details that are pretty, and "well-written" but don't add anything to the story. Do we need to know what is in someone's wastepaper basket if those items don't figure in anything? There's a lot of description here of what is happening, but very little in-depth. The description of the car crash, e.g., is very precise, but so what? It reveals nothing about any of the characters involved. The author seems to think that a fatal accident is enough by itself, that being a priest, or a hooker, is enough -- but that's lazy, imo. Although stereotypes can be brought alive, these are not -- the conflicted priest, the intelligent hooker. Also, the structure is too clever by half. I have a feeling this author sat down and asked himself what would sell. Set the book in NYC, check. Use the World Trade Center at the height of its glory, check. Use a clever structure of vaguely intertwined stories, check. And it worked. The book became very popular. It's not a bad read, but it didn't live up to its hype, in my opinion.
