This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
McCann's characters come to life in a marvelous, true-to-life manner in a city as gritty and unpredictable as the characters themselves. At his best, McCann invites the reader into a world as real as their own and, yet, so very different. Oh, how I would enjoy spending an afternoon with some of McCann's characters! From laugh-out-loud moments to very real sadness, McCann's world was indeed spinning and, in spite of some turbulence along the way, I didn't want to get off. We're all entitled to our opinions but I, for one, hope you won't allow the negative reviews to keep you from reading this wonderful, life-affirming book.
