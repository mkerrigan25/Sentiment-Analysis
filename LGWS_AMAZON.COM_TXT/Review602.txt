This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I grew up in NY & love it. The best thing for me in the book were the descriptions of places I have known for decades. The basic idea of the book is brilliant: a tapestry of this fascinating city at a moment of transcendent personal achievement, Philippe Petit's walk/dance across a wire between the Twin Towers. Each chapter, told from inside the mind of a particular character, is like a writing class exercise. Some of the characters are interesting, others aren't. I found that I was often bored, wondering how much more time I would have to spend with an uninteresting person. Based on what I had read about this novel, I kept expecting an ending that would brilliantly bring the disparate parts & characters together. It didn't happen. All in all, this trip isn't worth the effort.
