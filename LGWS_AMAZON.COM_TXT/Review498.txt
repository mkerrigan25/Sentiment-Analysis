This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A very readable book that examines hope and faith from a variety of perspectives. Set in New York in the 70s it centers around a specific day when Philip Petit walked between the World Trade Centre towers, and how that day unfolded for the individuals that are central to the story. A pair of Irish brothers in New York looking for their futures, streetwalking whores and Park Avenue's elite all contribute their perspectives on the fortunes that life has given them.
A well written book, it slows down a bit but finishes with a surprizing twist. Very thought provoking.
