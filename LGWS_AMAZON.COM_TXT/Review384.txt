 don't believe the hype...this book falls way short, April 11, 2011

After hearing all the positive, glowing reviews of this book, I wanted to read it myself. I was sorely disappointed. What a mess. It starts out interesting enough to grab your attention, but it quickly deteriorates. By page 200 or so I realized that it wasn't going to get any better. I read another 30 pages or so and wanted to finish it for the sake of finishing it, but I couldn't force myself to do it. The book's focus shifts primarily to Tillie, the washed-up hooker. Am I supposed to care? Am I supposed to feel sorry for her? The message by this point seems to be that she became a hooker because, poor thing, she didn't have a choice. Please. Don't be fooled: this book has more to do with the seedy underbelly of prostitution in NYC than anything else. I did find the storyline of the mother of the Vietnam vet slightly compelling, but so little of the book focused on that. Don't bother reading this book; it will only be a waste of your time. NOT recommended!
