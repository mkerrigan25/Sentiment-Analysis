This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Very satisfying read. Bought this for a college english class, but it's totally something I'd read for fun. I had the chance to meet the author in class, too, he's a great guy. Definitely watch the famed Man on Wire documentary along with this. As someone who grew up in NYC, the imagery and specific places/etc really hit home.
