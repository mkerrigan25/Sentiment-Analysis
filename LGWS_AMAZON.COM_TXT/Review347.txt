This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
Instead of chapters, this book is divided into four books, each with subsections like chapters. I almost put the book down after reading the first section about the tightrope walker. It is slow and needlessly verbose. Ditto the third portion, "Miro, Miro, on the Wall" about Claire on Park Avenue. I'm glad I continued reading. The rest of the book is much better.

McCann manages to string together a tightrope walker, an Irish self-styled monk and his brother, mother & daughter prostitutes and the daughter's children, a Jewish judge and his non-Jewish wife who live in a penthouse on Park Avenue, a health care worker, a support group of mothers who lost a child in the Vietnam war, and two artists, in a skillfully believable way. The reader encounters a complex of emotions - guilt, grief, frustration, love, shattered idealism, self-centered ambition - as these characters travel their various connecting paths.

Different sections are written from the point of view of the various characters, so style varies accordingly. I sometimes find that books written in this "jump around" technique distance me from the characters so I don't care about any of them, but that did not happen with this book. Part of McCann's skill is that the sequence fits together like pieces of a puzzle. I was ready for each section as it came to build on the whole.

Overall, the book is well-written with a cast of interesting characters. Having lived through the 70s and grown up in north Jersey where I frequently hopped a bus into Manhattan for various events, I enjoyed the look back. This definitely added to my enjoyment of the book, but such a background is not essential. If you have never spent time in a big city or if you prefer books with a pastoral setting, you may not relate well to these characters.
