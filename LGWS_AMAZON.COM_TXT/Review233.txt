This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The optimism of Colum McCann's novel begins in the title, reminding us that the world is much more than our individual lives and its ceaseless spinning is as likely to deliver joy as it is to deliver sorrow. The story is mostly set in New York City in August 1974 when Phillipe Petit strung a wire between the towers of the World Trade Center and mesmerized much of the city 110 stories below. At that time the city was at its low point -- decrepit, bankrupt, crime-ridden -- and much of the action takes place in a Bronx Housing project where an Irish monk named Corrigan has opened his apartment to the hookers who ply their trade under the Deegan Expressay and fallen in love with a Guatemalan nurse who is the widow of a death squad officer. The monk's brother, Ciaran, arrives from Ireland and is appalled by but also drawn to two of the streetwalkers, Tillie and her 17-year-old daughter, Jazmin, who has toddler twins of her own. Across the river in Manhattan is Claire, wife of a judge and bereaved mother of a son lost in Vietnam, who has found some solace for her grief by getting to know other women whose sons died in southeast Asia. And there is Lara, a daughter of privilege and artist, who left behind drugs and alcohol when she escaped the city a year earlier but disastrously falls right back in on her first return to the city. As Petit dances across his wire, the lives of these characters collide in a tragedy, but the great world spins on, and ultimately delivers the survivors to redemption and joy.
