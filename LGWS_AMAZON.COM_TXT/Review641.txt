This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I remember when Philippe Petit did his tightrope walk between the Trade Center towers. I was late for work and didn't linger, but I saw him and I was thrilled.

This astonishing and lovely book uses that walk to highlight the oblique connections which bind New Yorkers. The characters run the range and diversity of City dwellers and share the leveling moments that erode the barriers between them. Intimate strangers, and all that.

The language is tight and fresh and genuine. I really liked most of these people. They surprised me, made me laugh and made me cry.

This is a great book about New Yorkers. Thank you, Colum McCann.
