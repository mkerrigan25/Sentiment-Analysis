This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
The image of Phillipe Petite on the wire between the Twin Towers unites the characters in this book. And what characters they are! The fate of the Twin Towers and 9/11 are never mentioned, but that reality also permeates this book. A must read!
