This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Kindle Edition)
I found the book disjointed and there was no real storyline. I struggled to relate to the main characters and the book kept moving off in different directions with no apparent links to what had gone before. in the end a vague connection is established between the disparate groups of people . For me this made the book frustrating.
