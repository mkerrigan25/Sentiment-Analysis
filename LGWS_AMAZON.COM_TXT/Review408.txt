This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I could not disagree more with the majority of reviewers. This book was so contrived and heavy-handed that I just could not force myself to keep reading. In one of the vignettes, a character recalls how her dead son, a computer programmer charged with counting the dead in Vietnam, envisioned the internet. In another instance, a young Catholic priest has a forbidden love affair, only to die in a car accident with a hooker. The writing is so flowery and the story lines are so improbable that I really felt like the author underestimated his readers' intelligence. Other reviewers seem to feel bad about giving this book a bad review. I certainly don't. Don't waste your money on this book! It is so contrived it will make you queasy!
