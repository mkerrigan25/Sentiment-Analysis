This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I was ready to put down the book at page 60 but persevered and was well-rewarded. I love "historical" novels set in NYC before it became a gated community for the uber-wealthy and this book delivered. The writer did a good job of weaving together lots of characters meting out acceptable levels of justice without jumping the shark.
