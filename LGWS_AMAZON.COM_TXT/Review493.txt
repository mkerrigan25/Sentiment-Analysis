This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This was such a well written book, it was amazing how he was able to weave the stories together in the most unusual ways. It always surprised me. The book was very emotional and I was involved with the story right away. This book is very impressive, Colum McCann was able to tell two stories at one time and you are able to see both pictures at the same time, that is good writing. I would have liked the ending to be expanded a little. It seems authors will write detailed accounts during the begining of a book and as it ends there is the feeling I have to get out quickly, if I were an editor I would have encourage some authors to take a little more time before they leave the story; not a lot but a few more paragrphs would do it. In spite of this flaw I would higly recommend this book.
