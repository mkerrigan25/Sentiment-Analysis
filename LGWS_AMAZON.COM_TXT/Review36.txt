I stumbled upon this book, and I am so glad I did. I hadn't heard of Colum McCann before. Now he's on my short list of favorite authors. He cost me many hours of sleep, keeping me riveted to his novel. He does a superb job intertwining the many characters, making you feel you know them like they are family.
