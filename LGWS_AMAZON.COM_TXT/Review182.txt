This book is so intense that I read it holding my breath. It's beautiful and tragic. It's poetic and heart-wrenching. At the very beginning the walker on the tightrope seems to be the one making the wonder, the miracle. He's the one walking on a thin line over the world, making acrobatics. But very soon, after few pages, we discover that the real acrobat is not him, but the "normal" people walking on the streets. Down there there are many individual stories, involuntarily and secretly tangled. As the read proceeds, we got caught in the intricate existences of some of the Acrobat's viewers. In their stories we found the real struggle, the real miracle. As I was nearing the end of the book I couldn't make up my mind if I wanted to read it fast to know what was next or I wanted to prolong the reading to savour it more. In conclusion, this book offers an unique experience. It's unforgettable and surely, as soon as I closed it, I felt I wanted to read it again, because there are still so many layers, so many details, so many shades to discover.
