This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I'll leave the synopsis to the many other reviewers.

It didn't live up to the hype for me. Great premise & intentions, but around the halfway point I realized it was not going to get me there. The pace doesn't suit the NYC setting, and the characters are a polarized pastiche (hard luck prostitutes, silly immigrants, a fortunate park ave couple, and some bohemian artists) where I was hoping for a nuanced cast that evolves through interaction rather than description.

On the bright side, the characters are absolutely believable (though not palpable), and McCann manages to reveal some touching truths about human nature.
