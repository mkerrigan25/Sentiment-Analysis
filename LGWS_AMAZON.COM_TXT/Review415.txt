This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I have never read McCann before but I sure will again. Let The Great World Spin is better than good, this is outstanding literature. If you like great prose, follow these seemingly unrelated chapters to the end. Just wonderful writing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
