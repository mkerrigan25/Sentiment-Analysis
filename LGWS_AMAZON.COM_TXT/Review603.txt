This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. It is truly one of the best books I've read in a very long time. The language is poetic, the characters wove themselves into my heart. While reading the words, I often felt as if I were in midair, balancing on high, as the tightrope walker did all those years ago. Despite the losses and pain of the New Yorkers who are portrayed, there is such hope and connection in this book. Rich and poor, black and white, different cultures, different neighborhoods, all are bridged through interlocking stories and through acts of lovingkindness. My biggest issue with this story is that it will take me time before I am able to pick up another book. I just don't want to let this one go.
