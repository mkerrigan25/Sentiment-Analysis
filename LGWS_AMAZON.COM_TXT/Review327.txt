 Loved it, but regret buying Kindle version, March 23, 2012

I loved this book, which was a selection of my book club. Several other members bought traditionally bound books to our discussion, so I saw how much my Kindle version lacked, especially a photo which would have added to my enjoyment. The e-book also lacked the Discussion Topics for Book Clubs in the back, which I always enjoy pondering whether I'm reading for Book Club or not. Given these missing parts & my reading preferences, the Kindle-version was not worth the small amount saved (over the paperback).
