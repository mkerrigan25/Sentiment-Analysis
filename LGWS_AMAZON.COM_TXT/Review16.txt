This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book was very complex, the characters very interesting. I was lucky enough to hear the author Colum McCann speak about the book yesterday and he was wonderful! I left his lecture with a better understanding of his inspiration for the book and plan on reading it a second time. There was so much I missed the first time. I definitely recommend it!
