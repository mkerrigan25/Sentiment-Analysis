This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I read the negative reviews for this book first, and noticed that many of the readers got bogged down at a certain point and stopped reading. So why am I calling this "a glorious book"? Because I did something I almost never do---I went back to it after several weeks, partly due to my husband's urgings "it really does all come together" and partly due to that fact that I really knew it was extremely well written. All I can say is, if you hit that wall about a third of the way through, keep going! It doesn't last long, and you'll be wonderfully rewarded.
I found the story unique, the tightrope walk between the Twin Towers a clever device, and wonderful unforgetable characters. Claire's grief was almost too painful to read. And, unlike so many books, it had a satisfying, forgiving ending. Some of the social commentary reminded me of the best of Tom Wolfe, that is, Tom Wolfe with a heart.
