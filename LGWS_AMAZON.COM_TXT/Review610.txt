This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This book was a purely delightful read from cover to cover. McCann is an accomplished writer and he has created a story that is entertaining and thought provoking on topics from racism to religion. It was one of those rare books that you are sorry when to see the last line: the world spinning.
