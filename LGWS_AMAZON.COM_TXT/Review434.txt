This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Ok, some of the chapters do not need to be included in the book, but just a few.
The author has done an incredible job in the book, relating characters, their thoughts, their goals (religious, making connections, finding love), to the tight rope walker. Does anyone have the answer to "why we are here on earth," or "what is the goal of a human being or group of humans on earth"? Addressed also,was the NYC milieu: how do some many people with such diverse backgrouns manage to create a life in the city? Yet, this book has universal appeal Also, ask yourself how the author imagined such a way of connecting so many diverse people.
Our discussion group had a terrific time discussing the book. You can enter a discussion about this book from 1) talking about the chacters; 2) talking about the weaving of real life, symbols, stated and unstated goals in the book, and more. And, you will find pleasure in reading the book. I had to start the book twice, but once I saw what the author was doing, I just sat back and enjoyed the read. THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL BOOK.
