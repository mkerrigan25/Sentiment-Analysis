This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I've been waiting to read Let the Great World Spin for a few months now. When I first read the reviews about this it seemed like it would be right up my alley. Each chapter in the novel is written from a different characters perspective and their lives end up intersecting. It sounds cool, not exactly original but cool. The characters were awful. None of them seem the least bit real or interesting. One chapter written from the point of view of a prostitute was almost unreadable. I wanted to quit reading so many times but I kept thinking it would get better. That is not the case. I have no idea why it is so acclaimed.
