This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This was definitely worth reading. I loved the way all the characters lives were intertwined and everything came together. If you enjoyed this book I highly recommend checking out the documentary "Man on a Wire" - it's a perfect accompaniment to this read.
