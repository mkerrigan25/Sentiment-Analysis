This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
The way the characters spun together was very intriguing and interesting to say the least. The book starts off with the tight rope walker in NYC, which happens to be a true a story. From there it is the stories of several different people that are involved with other groups of people and then branches off to those people's lives (sounds confusing but it's really not). This novel is heartfelt and the human emotions were very powerful to me. This is more than a novel one reads for entertainment as it dives deep into some heavy subjects and reiterates the old "don't judge a book by it's cover", everyone is unique and everyone's life is special and because of that it will not be one of those books I have read that are quickly forgotten.
