 The Wire That Must Be Walked, September 15, 2011
ByÂ Marc Flanagan "Reading Through Lunch"
(Santa Monica, CA. USA/ Dublin, Ireland) - 
This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
As last weekend was the observation of a decade since the towers of The World Trade Center came down that tragic day, I recalled reading this novel a few months ago and how much I admired the authors tale telling and character invention. The French tightrope walker and his feat of crossing between the North and South WTC towers is at the core of the novel, that starts in Dublin and ends up playing out in Manhattan in the early 70's. A great read, I look forward to the authors next creation.
