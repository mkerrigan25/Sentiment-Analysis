This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I enjoyed this book for the fact that it is a story. The characters introduced and the plot moves are plausible taking the reader from the hinterlands of Ireland to gritty New York City. I would recommend this book to a reader who is more interested in the overall story then loads of action.
