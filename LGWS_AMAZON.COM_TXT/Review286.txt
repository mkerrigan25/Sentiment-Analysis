This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I had to force myself to finish this book (was a choice of my book club so I did read it all). Don't know whether it was because he wrote too well (made me feel I was immersed in the savage world of characters living on the edge of existence) or not well enough. There were so many points of view from which the story was told that it was a little disorienting because new chapters might shift suddenly to a different character. He's a well-regarded author, but I wouldn't choose another book by him.
