I loved this book. I was impressed with the complexity of the characters' connections to each other. The story was original and told in an intriguing and creative fashion. The author took a real event and developed an entire setting for it that included apparently unrelated characters and other events. While the book was never predictable, it was entirely believable. I was very impressed and plan to read other books of this author.
