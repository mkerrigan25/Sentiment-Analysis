This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I love love love this book. I enjoyed every word. Don't read it without a highlighter. This story is smart, gripping, and really touches the soul. I enjoyed the different storylines and characters. I fell in love with each one of them.
