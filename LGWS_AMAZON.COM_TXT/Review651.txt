This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
It has been a while since a book moved me to tears, but Let The Great World Spin managed to do it several times. Part of its appeal is the wonderful language used and how it changes as the focus shifts from character to character throughout the novel. But, the more relevant appeal is how it seamlessly connects a time 30+ years ago with our world in 2001 and then today. This is a novel of New York, a novel of connections, and a meditation on who we are and how our actions spin forward in time.
