This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Here is some superb and sublime writing. I found the first few chapters almost hypnotic in style, tone and substance. I was drawn right in.

It's a wonderfully crafted, structured and woven piece...however, the unrelenting and often puzzling introduction of new voices distracts and eventually dilutes the novel as a whole. The threads between them become more tenuous, the voices less real...and then there's a leap forward in time and space that breaks the thread entirely.

Still very much worth reading. But a pity: a more focused edit could have elevated the novel to another level.
