This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Five stars, but the Amazon system is not picking up my rating. A brilliant, vivid beginning that earns itself in the stories that follow. Wow, what a hook. I'd read anything McCann writes from here on out.Let the Great World Spin: A Novel
