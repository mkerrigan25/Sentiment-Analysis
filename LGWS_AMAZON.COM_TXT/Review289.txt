I enjoy a book that has a plot and moves along. This book was a very disjointed collection of stories. The single thread that tied them together was an illegal high wire walk between the two trade center towers in NYC. If I had to say what the plot was, I'd say it is serendipity. I thought the writing was wonderful and the characters believable, but the lack of a plot really hurts this book.
