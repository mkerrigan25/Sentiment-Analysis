This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Irish, they have the gift: Beckett, Brehan Swift, Joyce, scores of scores more and now we are gifted Colum MaCann and his "Let the Great World Spin."

There aren't enough accolades. His writing is lyrical. It's rhythm and pace though 300 and more pages is flawless - a sonnet written in prose. The story defies imagination, is complex yet simple in understanding - a mirror in many respects, a view out in others. For a long book that goes into the soul of its characters, lays the detail of contents out like prunes in a drying shed, it is magnetic and impossible to put down.

I do a lot of reading and this novel is high on my list - perhaps on the top. If you like life, its facets, its population and circumstances, suffering into joy and joy into death, you will enjoy this book - maybe learn from it. Thank You Colum McCann
