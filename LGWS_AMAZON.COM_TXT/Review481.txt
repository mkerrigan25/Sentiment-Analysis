This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This book is wonderfully written. "The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough." The story is centered on Philippe Petit who walked a tightrope wire between the World Trade Center towers on August 7, 1974 but describes the interrelated events of that day. It tell the story of the Philippe, the judge who arraigned him, the judge's wife who lost a son in Viet Nam, a club of mothers who lost sons in Viet Nam, a mother and daughter both prostitutes, the daughter's twin daughters, a monk and his brother, computer hackers in California and others. Although vastly different, Colum weaves the story of these people together but makes each a real character with thoughts, feelings, and views of the world. The story moves forward and because of the writing and story it is the type of book that you want to read but not to end. The ending was satisfying but not hyper dramatic. It also weaves the themes of war (from World War II, through Viet Nam to Iraq), segregation, prostitution, rich, poor, and gives you time to think as you move through these ideas. One of the very best books for me this year, and I would definitely recommend it.
