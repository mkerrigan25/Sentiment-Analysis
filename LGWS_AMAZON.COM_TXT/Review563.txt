This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
All of the grand reviews of this book are well-founded, this was a heartfelt and enormous story. McCann has launched a magic carpet ride on a gritty rug that is sometimes threadbare and moth-eaten, but gets you there, nonetheless. The characters were nicely expressed, although there were moments when I felt their plot connections a bit too contrived. What were the chances...REALLY...that Claire would have an encounter with the young daughters of the dead hooker her husband had just seen in court? In all of New York? And the chapters dealing with the hackers and the tag-photographer riding the subway felt like red herrings...what was up with that? Still, the author has a way with words, I could feel the weight of a humid night on the streets, almost like the sweat rolling down my own back. Beautifully done. Worth the read, definitely.
