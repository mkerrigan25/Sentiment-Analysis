This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
Another fine novel by McCann. The writing is superb and his interweaving of the well drawn characters unmatched. Moving between neighborhoods, no part of New York City remains untouched. An excellent rendering of multilayered lives and all the hopes and dreams within as well as the heartbreak.
