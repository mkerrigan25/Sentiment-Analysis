This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Profound, and transcendant. This book is being called the first NYC novel after 9/11. It expresses the hope of our lives and is a fascinating look at one day and the affect of a unique experience on many desperate lives. Highly recommend it
