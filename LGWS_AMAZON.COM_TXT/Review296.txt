I was thrilled to receive an advance reader's copy of LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN three and a half years ago but somehow it never made it to the top of my "to be read" pile until this week. I have always been fascinated by New York City and Irish writer Colum McCann does a good job describing both the place and the very specific time period in which the novel takes place. He tells his slice of life story from the viewpoint of several very diverse people who are somehow connected to each other on August 7, 1974 the day a young Frenchman walked across a tightrope spanning the two world trade center towers. A saintly Irish member of a religious order, his visiting brother, a couple of Bronx prostitutes, some moms mourning the losses of their sons in Viet Nam, the judge who arraigns the tightrope walker and an artist from a wealthy family who has squandered much of her twenties on drugs and wild parties are some of the most memorable characters who are all interconnected in surprising ways. McCann is able to give credible voices to these people including three African American women. I also like the way McCann uses a very specific real life incident to anchor the stories of his fictional characters. And McCann has a lot to say about social justice and problems that still exist in American society. Yet I still feel this ambitious book doesn't quite live up to what it could have been.
