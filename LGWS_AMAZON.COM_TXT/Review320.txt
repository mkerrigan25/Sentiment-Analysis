I think people who don't like this book just don't like a certain style of writing. I felt hit over the head by redundant descriptions that felt just there for the sake of describing, and bordered on editorializing and were sometimes cliched. That can annoy some readers. However there is optimism in it, and a unique kind of momentum.

I do believe that McCann must be a lover of poetry. In fact I'd love to see whether he has published any long-form prose poems. I think he's ripe for that format.
