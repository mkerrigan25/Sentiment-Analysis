This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Masterful piece where the story lines intersect in the most interesting ways. It makes the reader aware of the complexity of life and the drama in our everyday existence. It shows us how our lives are composed of thousands of strands woven together to make this one moment. McCann is a wonderful writer with amazing insight into humanity. A must read!
