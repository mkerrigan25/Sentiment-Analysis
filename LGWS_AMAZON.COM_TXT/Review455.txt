This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
McCann's writing has me hooked . The eleven or twelve characters who narrate this novel are welcome around my table at anytime. They are my kind of people. Their deep passion is unique to each and springs from their soul. I foresee rereading this book many times (3 times already) just to have their company. It makes the struggles of a spinning world more bearable just knowing where to find them.
