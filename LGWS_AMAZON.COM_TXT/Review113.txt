This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I liked the story and eagerly pursued the book until done. But the stream of consciousness narrative style ran on a bit too much for my liking.

That said the insights in the book and the observations were rich and innovative.

Colum is a strong writer who captures humanity with humanity.
