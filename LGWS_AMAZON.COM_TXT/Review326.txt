 Great Novel with Substance, March 26, 2012
ByÂ Tiffany Heffner

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Kindle Edition
Let the Great World Spin is about a cast of characters surrounding the 1974 high-wire walk of Phillipe Petit between the World Trade Center towers in New York City. There is an entire sequence of events set into place upon the trial of Petit. The rest I will leave for your reading pleasure.

My attention was immediately captured when I started the book. At some point a few chapters in, I got a bit confused, but stuck with it and everything made sense in the end. It is a book you really have to pay attention to and take notice of the intricate details. It is brilliantly and poetically written. Themes of chance and destiny pervade throughout and cause you to continue thinking about it even after you finish the last sentence. The true hallmark of a good book (or movie), in my opinion, is the aftermath of thought. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great novel with substance.
