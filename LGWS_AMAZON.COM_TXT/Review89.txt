This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
We discussed this in my book club and the consensus was mixed. Although most of us appreciated the post-modernism structure, it left some of us with a sense that there was a lack of cohesion. Characters were integrated sporadically. It reminded me of the movie "Crash," in some ways. There's always a subculture in society, and there are always outliers, but that doesn't always make for a great novel.
