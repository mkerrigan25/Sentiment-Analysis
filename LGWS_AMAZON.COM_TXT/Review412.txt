This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
"Let The Great World Spin" left me in awe of McCann's ability to capture the distinctive voices
of each of his New York characters, as well as their poignant stories and textured lives.
Full of life and breath, each poetic phrase thrums with what it takes to survive,
not only in New York City, but anywhere. All tied together by the breathtakingly
lyrical description of the tightrope walker, Philippe Petit's journey from
one tower to the other.
