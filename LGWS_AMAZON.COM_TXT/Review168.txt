A friend recommended this book, and though I love Irish writers such as Colm Toibin and William Trevor, I did not know about Colum McCann. Now I plan to read everything he's written. This is a wonderful, multi-layered book. It takes many stories and weaves them into a very satisfying whole, the only linking factor being the famous Twin Towers tightrope walk by Philippe Petit. I could not bear to put the book down, and read it in every spare minute. The quality of the writing is superb, often lyrical, and McCann brilliantly captures the voices of a cast of very diverse people. Above all it is a great book about New York, a city I knew well during the period in which the stories are set.
