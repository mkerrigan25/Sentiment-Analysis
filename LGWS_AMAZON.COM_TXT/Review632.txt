This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
The paradox of great fiction is how much truth is portayed. I really enjoyed the format of the story. If you are a fan of the short story format, I think you will enjoy this book too. I had to put the book down for several weeks and was able to easily get back into it. So that was convenient, but each chapter and 'book' was a story in it's own right. The high wire act serving as a connecting thread throughout. More interestingly was the 'intersection' of the stories and the lives therein and how McCullum was able to maintain the surprises through to the very end. If you enjoyed any of the following stories, I tink you would also like this book: "I know Why the Caged Bird Sings" by Maya Angelo; "Beloved" by Toni Morrison, "The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao" by Junot Diaz. I would not be at all surprised to see the book win the Pulitzer.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings
Beloved (Everyman's Library)
The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
