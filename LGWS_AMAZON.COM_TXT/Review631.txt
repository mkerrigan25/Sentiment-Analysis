This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I was floored by this book, read it with abandon, felt rudderless when it was done. I've bought it for 3 friends now, not all of whom have loved it as I did. It is dark in places, and gritty, and there is a melancholy that sits with you throughout, but to me it was hopeful above all else - an ode to the power and beauty of imagination.
I read it on my Kindle to start, but will order the hard copy now. It's the kind of book that deserves a place on the shelf, where it can be picked up time and again.
