This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
One of the better novels to address the emotions, trauma and life after the terrorist attack on NYC and on the collective American consciousness. This book shows us what makes America so attractive, despite of all the vices, the social underpinning, the non-sense death. This book achieves an almost Gatsby-like response, sprung from the landscape that millions called home yet outsiders might view it a corrupted, unrelenting social distortion, laid wasted after the towers crumble to Earth.

Reading this book is an amazing journey, the levels, the characters, and interconnectedness of our lives that we sometimes try so hard to disassociate from.
