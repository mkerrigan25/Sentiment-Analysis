This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This is a beautifully crafted novel that explores the things that bind us all together by following a collection of seemingly disparate characters who all witnessed a single event: a man tight-roping. This is one of those rare novels that is both entertaining and truly literary. I honestly believe that Colum McCann is one of the greatest writers of our time and I can't recommend this book strongly enough.
