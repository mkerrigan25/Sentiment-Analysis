This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
For me, the true test of how good a book is has to do with how quickly I read portions of it. In this case I tore through the first two-thirds (because it was terrific and gripping) and drew to a snail's pace for the final third (as I simply did not want it to end). For me this is the highest praise.

From the outset the characters grab you and McCann's writing pulls you in and forces you to care about them - you may not like them but you root for them nonetheless. His writing is extremely poetic and invokes more imagery - both internal and external - than almost any other author I've read. To take a famous public event and then wrap multiple stories around it is artistic genius.

Also, it was appropriate that Dave Eggers had written one of the reviews contained in the book, because this is along the same lines as one of his novels.
