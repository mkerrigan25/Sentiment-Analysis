This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)

The inspiration for Colum McCann's tale of `70's New York City is Philippe Petit's tightrope walk, strung between the now gone Twin Towers. People too young to have lived at that time will be jolted at the thought of such a walk...those of us who were kicking around the universe at that time will unravel a small germ of a memory and try to remember where we were when we heard the news of Petit's quirky, death-defying journey that summer day, now 35 years ago.

McCann takes this centerpiece of his tale to weave short vignettes of observers lives, observers in that NYC melee that day, kaleidoscopically trailing lives through shadows of other lives. Populated with priests, prostitutes, grieving mothers, socialites, judges, immigrants and artists, McCann brings them all to life. Do they connect at random, or are they meant to find each others' paths that strange day? Each of them views the incredible act of the quixotic Petit as a symbol. Each, in turn, becomes part of McCann's tapestry of redemption. We go on, we do, in spite of all odds - the human condition is never more strikingly illustrated than in this novel.

His prose wondrous, his vision clear, McCann starts slowly, but leaves his readers breathless. I can't tell you how much I loved this book; it has stayed with me and and resurrected itself again and again in the month since I finished. As Gloria, one of the book's most sympathetic character says... "Sometimes you've got to go up to a very high floor to see what the past has done to the present"...

Take that journey to that high floor - don't delay. This novel gets my highest recommendation; read it as soon as you can and celebrate McCann's work.
