This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I initially enjoyed this book, but I found it to be more tedious and uncontrolled as it stretched on. Some of the characters and vignettes are very well developed, but some lack something real and relatable. I think it's worth a read.
