This is a beautiful book. Compelling story and extraordinary writing. It is my favorite type of writing. Poetic. The context of the story is my New York City. The city of the 70s and early 80s. A rough and dirty time but magical as New York is. So on that level I related to it. But anyone would love this story - how it twist and turns, maybe I should say spins. Each character is fully developed and the author writes each story in the character's voice. I also loved how the story developed with different pieces that came together like a puzzle. Enjoy it.
