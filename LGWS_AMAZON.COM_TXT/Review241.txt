This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Using the high wire walk between the World Trade Center towers in 1974 as thread to stitch his stories together, Let the Great World Spin author Colum McCann has written a tapestry of a book. The social economic and cultural s boundaries are torn away to reveal how very alike we all are. It was a wonderful read.
