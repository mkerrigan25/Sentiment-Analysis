 Boring., February 10, 2010

Lauren (Buffalo, NY) - See all my reviews

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Boring, uninspired. I was shocked to see all the good reviews. You are constantly waiting for the book to pick up. The problem? It never does. In some spots a light shines through, for just a brief moment, but then is taken away with monotonous lead-ins and poor development. I finished the book just for the sake of finishing, not because I cared what happened at the end.
