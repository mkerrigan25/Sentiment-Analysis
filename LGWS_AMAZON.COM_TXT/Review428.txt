This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I didn't love this book, but I liked it enough to recommend it. But I do want to make a point that this book is NOT about Philippe Petit.
To me it was an interesting view of how close we all are to each other, one way or another and how interesting people can be regardless of who they are and what they do.
I do have to admit that some parts of the book are more entertaining than others, but they have to be read to understand what is going on.
