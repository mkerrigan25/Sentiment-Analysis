This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I loved this book. Colum McCann is a very talented writer: his prose is elegant, spare, and evocative. I was totally engaged from the moment I read the first paragraph. I was not able to put this book down and I told all my friends they just "had" to read it.

I recommended "Let the Great World Spin" for our book group (10 women, all of us have kids, and we meet once a month). Almost everyone in the group loved it. There were a couple of people who thought it was too complicated and had trouble with the fact that the first chapters seem almost unconnected from one another, until you realize that each deals with a character who is experiencing the same events from a different perspective. But most of us agreed that this was one of the best books we've ever read.
