This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
There are "Questions and Topics for Discussion" at the end of this book. I thought I'd add a few more.

How many people die in this book? What different ways do they die? Did you find all those deaths depressing?

How much did the book remind you of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities"? Which book is funnier?

Are readers who prefer funny books shallow and superficial and unable to appreciate great writing?

The action begins in Sandymount. Does that mean anything? What is a Martello tower?

How much did the book remind you of Adrian Nicole LeBlanc's "Random Family"?

What was Corrigan's father's problem?
