 Poetically painful read, September 6, 2011

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Hardcover

Started off strong and almost promising excitement and surprise when you read about the funambulist. Soon after the book changes to detail people's lives that you hope will be made sense of later. Some characters get great attention and others much less, but the majority of the book it seems is about Hookers and a religious man who spends his life taking a beating by choice.

To put it lightly this book is a mild torture. It is melancholic throughout its entirety and really makes a point of all the bad that exists in the world. I don't know what the author intended by his exemplification of the widespread misery and uncertainty in these people's lives. The short bits of good news and the minimal devotion to the few happy characters weren't enough.

Yes the world is a place where bad things happen and yes no one is completely exempt. Understood. The books was filled with people plagued with personal problems on a fundamental level and really that is no cause worth celebrating with description
