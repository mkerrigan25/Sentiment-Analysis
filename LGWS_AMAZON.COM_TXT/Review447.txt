This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
The story was brilliant. The characters were brilliant. The writing was brilliant. I admit the National Book Award steered me to it, and I have to say the judges knew what they were talking about. I've been let down by their choices before, but this one is a timeless read I'd recommend to anyone.
