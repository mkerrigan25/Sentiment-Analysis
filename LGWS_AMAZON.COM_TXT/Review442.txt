This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
Seriously, who doesn't love New York. Sure, maybe on the surface we sometimes think it's too much. Too "out there". Too "if only they would behave". But deep down, aren't we all a little proud that there is such a thing as New York. With all its quirks and bravado. This book is an amazing feat, as it takes you to Manhattan on the day that guy walked between the Twin Towers. Then the symbol of nonsensical capitalism, now the symbol of freedom. The book guides you through different stories (much like the movie 'Crash' does) of different people. One more gripping than the other. They all have the 'Man on the Wire' in common - but also much more. I was gripped by the book.
