This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
McCann is Irish, but he writes about New York with such a critical knowledge and understanding of the city's many layers and cross sections of the populace that is truly amazing.

By interweaving the story of The Man of The Wire throughout the novel (somewhat Olive Kitteridge-ish style), he brings us to meet real people, each with their own demons, visions, mysteries, pains and pleasures. It's a multi-layered microcosm of New York City in the 1970's.... a series of short stories told from different viewpoints that are all interconnected the way people are interconnected.

The 'man on the wire' is central to the story, but his walk isn't the only force driving the novel. The book focuses on people and how they come together across lines that otherwise divide them.
A spinning together and how lives touch other lives in sometimes random ways.

Exploring how differently we all cope with the wires we walk, the spinning we encounter. Where we came from...where we are going...how to find the humor in even the most desperate situations.

This is what comes alive and resonates deeply in LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN.... a wonderfully crafted novel!
