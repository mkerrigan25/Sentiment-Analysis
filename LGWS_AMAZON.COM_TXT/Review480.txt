This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
Colum McCann is a brilliant writer able to understand and present many different cultures. The book is a snapshot of New York in 1974 revealing people from many different social and economic backgrounds. There is a common thread between all the people who are leading very different lives. Their stories are told with great compassion and insight.
