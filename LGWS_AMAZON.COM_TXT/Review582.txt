This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I thoroughly enjoyed Colum McCann's first two novels 'Songdogs' and 'This Side of Brigtness' but haven't read his last two, but definitely decided to return to check him out after all of the accolades this book received. And it is a great book, a fantastic New York story, a realistic portrayal of NYC in the 1970s, a good balance of inter-connected stories without making anything too unbelievable, but I believe something was missing, McCann was clearly reaching to write a 'great American novel' and he wrote a very good one, but not quite up to the expectations and the blurbs that accompany the paperback. So, recommended, but maybe don't read the quotes and hyperbole until after you finish, you'll probably enjoy it more...
