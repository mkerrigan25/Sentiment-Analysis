For me, this book contained a number of interesting smaller stories cleverly linked by the spectacle of Phillipe Petit's high wire walk between the twin towers back in the 1970s. Early on in the book I wasn't too sure where the story was going . . . it seemed a bit disjointed at times . . as if the author was making it up as he wrote without having a definite beginning,middle or end in mind.

Nevertheless some of the characters were very well drawn and overall it was worth the read.
