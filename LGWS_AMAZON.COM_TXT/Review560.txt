This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I feel that there have been so many great reviews written, all I can do is add to the praise for this book. About halfway through it, I remarked that it may be one of the best books I have ever read. Now that I am finished I think I need to wait a couple of months and make sure I am certain before I proclaim it the best ever. It's a beautiful work.

McCann is so good at taking ordinary, boring lives, and transforming them in to fantastic tales of humanity and complexity. Especially impressive is his ability to tailor his writing style to a particular narrator. This is what leads, I believe, to the charges that the writing is disjointed at times. I remember one particular passage when a judge is talking about the crimes and cases that he sees in his court. For one entire paragraph, he lists many of the charges in one run-on sentence. Sure, this is a little hard to read, but I saw it as a fed-up over-worked man going on a hopeless rant of disparagement.

McCann does try to add a 'hook' to each character, like the poor black woman who loves opera, or the prostitute who reads Rumi. But instead of being racist or patronizing, I think he is trying to convey that even in the midst of hopelessness and despair, there is always something beautiful about every person's life. Yes, Gloria may have lost her sons and live in a neighborhood where she gets mugged, but she escapes to the opera where she can remove her shoes and lose herself in the music.

Although the book is centered on the tightrope walker, its focus is on people. And all the bravery and weakness and beauty and vice that humanity entails.
