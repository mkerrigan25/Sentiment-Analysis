This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback
Loved,loved,loved this book. Perhaps because of the author's Irish background, the prose glides effortlessly and beautifully. This snapshot of New York on a day that is both prosaic and memorable provides many moments of grace and thoughtful reflection that will long stay with me. Like the Ghost of the Future in A Christmas Carol, we the reader know the fate that awaits the Twin Towers and the city. Yet we also see the roots of human love and interconnection that will allow New Yorkers to rise to the occasion. This book may be a lite version of Ulysses, but is well worth the read.
