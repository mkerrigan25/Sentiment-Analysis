This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I wanted to like this book, and I spent the first 3/4 of the book expecting all the tales to intertwine masterfully in the end. I was left disappointed.

There are many reviews, each better than this one, that give detail of the plot and the characters within. I won't dive into the details--I will merely say that the book is extremely well-written. McCann has a mastery over the English language and uses it well.

My main complaint is that there is little drama at the end, no real climax. The story peters out, and some of the tales continue and some come to a plaintive end. They all revolve, in some way, around the tight-roper between the World Trade Center, but that feels more like a plot device than a real focal point. It just feels forced to this reader.

I know many people loved the book. I had expected great things, and I was disappointed. Perhaps it does reveal the soul of NYC as I had read in a previous review. Apart from the appearance of the tight-rope walker, the story may as well have been set in Chicago or LA or any other city packed with various individuals from differing socio-economic states.
