This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I read the news ...oh boy...and basically on some levels, this is a compulsively good read.(I give it 3.5 stars for its juicy prose).

I enjoyed the interconnectedness of these disparate characters on a summer day circa 1974 in NYC. Actually, on the very day the Frenchman, Phillip Petit tight-roped between the twin towers. So it's a nice idea. There's much to like in the style of the writing--it is bursting with life and bon mots. But to me, great writing does not necessarily mean the story is there. That's -to me--the downside of this work. It's worth a read, though, in the sense that the concept is strong and there are sections and characters that are well-portrayed. It's the overall narrative I had a problem with.

There are other novels out there that are so effective because they contain a driving narrative that resonates with readers. The writing itself may not be exactly flourishing and florid as it is here, but the overall story is. Right to the very end.
In McCann's work here, I did not get that satisfactory overall arc that I needed to make this effort work--as a complete story. I wish writers (especially the prize-winning, "literary" ones) would learn this one.
