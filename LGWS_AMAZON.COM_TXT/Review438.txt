This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
This was such a wonderfully imagined and written series of stories that ultimately form an engrossing novel. Mr. McCann well deserves all of the accolades he has received for his work. My only difficulty (if you want to call it that) was that I could not spend longer stretches reading the book-I think the more time you can devote to reading would make the book flow better and better. Well done!
