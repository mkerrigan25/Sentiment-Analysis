This review is from: Let the Great World Spin Paperback

Above, a man walks on a tightrope between the Twin Towers. Below, a whole city lives...lives that are so different, yet the connections are unavoidable. Prostitutes, Irish monks, a judge, a Park Avenue wife, an African American woman. I love how the story weaved around each of these characters, and then, there it is, the tightrope above and around them. This story could only have been set in New York City, the city that has no past or future, just a present.
