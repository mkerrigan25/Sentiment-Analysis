This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
What a disappointment. This book was recommended to me by a writer I really respect, so as I slogged through it I kept expecting it to get better....somehow. But it only got worse. It was like watching desperately out-of-work actor rehearsing the same monologue over and over and over in the mirror using different voices and accents. And at the end of each chapter you hear him say to himself in the mirror, "Man...I'm gooood." I can become a young black female hooker, or a Jewish judge, or an Irish monk, or a French Tight-rope walker! This interminable novel is what happens when you really don't have a good story to tell.
