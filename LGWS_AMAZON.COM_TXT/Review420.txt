This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
At this point in my life (I am 56), I would like to have a book either make me feel good and/or move me forward philosophically. This book did neither. I was most interested in the "liberation theology" character in the book, but he really went nowhere and the rest of the story seemed formulaic.
