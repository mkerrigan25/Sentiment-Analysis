This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
I wanted to like this book, I really did. Instead, I found was a collection of arbitrary thought all muddled together encompassed by one or two centralized themes.

From the start of this book, I disliked the style of writing. At first I thought it like Stephen King's obsessive description of banal detail. Then I thought Kerouac and his three word mundane sentences. This happens. That happens. This exists. This is bad. This exists. They are there. I am here. At times I found the flow of Eggers or Sedaris, but I couldn't get incredibly interested in the story or it's characters. There seem to be just a bucketful of stories, as I said before, all muddled together in hopes of it being tied together in a neat little bow.

There are sometimes contemporary, historical, or pop-culture references that sometimes hold me into the section for a little longer, but all in all I was rarely engaged and did not feel it to be a page turner. I like certain relationships the protagonist has with the people he meets. I like the places he goes to visit, but for me the biggest flaw was in the non-descript style of writing. In my opinion it seems as though the writer can not find his voice, and it is not conducive to the story(ies) at all. There was no flow.

"Let the Great World Spin" may be attractive to several readers, but for me it was far from any literary masterpiece.
