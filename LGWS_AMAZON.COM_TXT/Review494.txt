This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Hardcover)
This is a novel of New York City, told in short stories that are linked through shared characters and a connection to Philippe Petit's 1974 real-life tightrope walk between the World Trade Center's Twin Towers. The stories interconnect and encounter characters in subsequent stories, all from different perspectives and with new revelations, the thoughts and observations of the spectators of Petit as he sets out to walk the tightrope between the Twin Towers in. This is such a wonderful, poignant weave of stories that somehow don't seem as complicated as it had to have been to write it. This powerful writing makes perfect sense. Great emotions captured in a wonderful writing style that made the read a pleasure! Wonderful!
