This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
I am an avid reader and in constant search for great novels. Let the Great World Spin, I can honestly say, is one of the best books I've ever read - masterfully crafted characters with whom all may relate, a realism which makes us laugh while breaking our hearts, and wholly structured in such a way that, after putting this book down, you will think about it for weeks after. McCann creates a spectrum of individuals which the reader is immediately drawn into, then cleanly connects them all; its a novel that will should completely change how you see the girl one on the side of the road or the man in the car beside you.
He captures the human spirit wonderfully.
Please read this novel.
