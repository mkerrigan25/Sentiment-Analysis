This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
It may have been given all the wonderful credentials, but I found it to be too much about the negative side of what goes on in peoples lives. I skimmed it to the end, and this is not something I usually do, but it was the right thing for me to get through it.
