This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
A novel of interlocking stories set in New York of the 1970s. Interweaving characters in this way (prostitutes, priests, a judge's wife, computer hackers) runs the risk of becoming ridiculous - it always feels false when someone attempts to create meaning out of piles of coincidences - but McCann largely succeeds. Most of the discrete sections feel complete, and the persistent reappearance of certain characters does not feel forced. This is a book that expands. It conveys the enormity of the world, while treasuring the human process of carving it into stories.

Some sections are stronger than others. In part this may be because McCann's writing style is surprisingly static from narrator to narrator, despite some curious cosmetic changes (sometimes speech is marked with quotation marks; sometimes not). He loves clipped, fragmentary, elusive sentences. He inhabits his characters without attempting to become them. Some come out more clearly than others. At worst, he can seem unconvincing and flat.

But the novel's momentum will carry the reader by its rough spots. Finishing it over the course of a day left me genuinely uplifted and touched. It is a sincere book that tries to speak to the world as it is. For McCann the possibility of beauty is an everyday thing, something to be earned through living, and the past is a curse that can recede. "Time doesn't cure everything, but it cures a lot."
