This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
As an artist/photographer, I thought he wrote this book from the eye of the camera and the heart of romantic. The details sparked my interest in the daily visuals that we see but miss because we are too occupied with getting somewhere. Step onto the tight line of danger and unknown space.
