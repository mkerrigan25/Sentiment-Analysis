This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I purchased the book from reviews. It is not one of the best books I have ever read but the characters came alive for me. I want to continue following their lives. I totally enjoyed the way the storeis were tied to one another. Am considering whether to recommend for my book club.
