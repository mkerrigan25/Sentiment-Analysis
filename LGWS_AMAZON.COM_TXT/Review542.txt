This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
I wish I had spent the time reading a non-fiction book about Philippe Petit, the man who walked a tightrope between the twin towers. Instead I read about a somewhat sad bunch of people whose stories were loosely connected by the events of August 7, 1974. And indeed, their lives were intertwined in other ways that were revealed in vignettes (with somewhat jarring transitions between them). I felt the selection of characters was almost intentionally chosen to show the author's prowess for exploring diversity. Some of the prose was cutesy as well, particularly in the story of Claire, a grieving mother whose son was killed in Vietnam. I won't go into each story - I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. And for me, it was exercise to keep going at times. I did keep reading though and eventually raised my star count from one to two. I now plan to read the real story of Philippe Petit - I am very curious to know what he was thinking!
