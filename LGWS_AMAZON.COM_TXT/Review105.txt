This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Kindle Edition)
A friend recommended this book so I was eager to read it. At first, it was okay...sort of drew me in the way a good book should. But, after sticking with it for many chapters, I put it down and will not finish it. In my opinion, it was way too descriptive...even a little annoying and difficult to follow the characters. Let's just say, it's not for everyone.
