I'm adding my hat to the pile of fabulous reviews of this novel. The first 25 pages or so are admittedly tough to slog through, but stick with it. This is one of the best books I've read in several years. Read the rest of the reviews for more summaries and analysis. I'm only adding to the average to make this higher rated.
