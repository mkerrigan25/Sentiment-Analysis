This could only have been written by an Irish writer. He is a wonderful writer and the book 'goes down easy'. But the lives he has us look at up close are tortured and unhappy and unlucky. I was depressed the whole time I was reading it. In true Irish form I started wondering if all lives are this unhappy underneath. And if the author says 'But I gave it a happy ending!', I have to say that's an ending that only an Irishman would call happy. It is beautifully written and worth reading.
