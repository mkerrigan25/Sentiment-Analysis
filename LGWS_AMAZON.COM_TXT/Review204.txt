This review is from: Let the Great World Spin: A Novel (Paperback)
This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Beautifully written, this author takes you on a journey, sometimes hard, but always worth it. As of now this is my favorite of all his books, though each and every one is well worth the read, and very different. Amazing how much research must go into each book, as he knows so much about the times and places he has written, the people and history in this country. He makes you feel like you know them too.
