Brooke Wiggins,"March 23, 2014",5.0,"Beautifully written novel set mainly in New York City depicting the lives of a wide variety of individuals and how they're actions impact one another. From priest to prostitute, judge to tight rope walker, Park Avenue to the projects, this story defines as well as defies stereotypes of several individuals intricately and truthfully portraying their humanism. The story flawlessly weaves together as it jumps to and from the different characters perspectives. Great read!",0.38888888888888884,negative review
Angela Chopyak,"March 20, 2014",5.0,I enjoyed the different characters and how the author developed each one if them in a way that you could easily picture them. I didn't think that he tied the idea tightly. If he wanted to focus on the tight rope walker he could have had more direct interaction.,0.6666666666666666,negative review

Mister Bonely (USA),"February 28, 2014",1.0,"I received this book as a sort of gift and went to an event where the author spoke about himself and read bits of his novel. I met people who enjoyed it and at the end of the event, I heard many people saying things like, ""He's so interesting"" and ""He's done so much.""

After reading his book and both seeing and hearing him speak in person, I wasn't impressed, with either the book or the man. Most of the people at the event were young and, in my opinion, too easily influenced. Talk of travel and roaming with the homeless of the subway, and suddenly you're the most fascinating person in the room. While I admit McCann's experiences sound interesting, the man himself seemed to me a proud, tiresome bore.

In fact, I almost didn't write a review because I didn't think it was worth the time. I don't mean to offend anyone, though I probably am. I had little feeling for him or his book, aside from the initial discontent and contempt--contempt, because I couldn't believe that anyone could be satisfied having their name on this book.

The beginning, especially the first set of characters, I found the most interesting (in fact, I even liked it somewhat)--I sometimes wonder if maybe that vignette in particular struck me the most because it was written with a certain...care. At the event, the author did mention (as he does in an interview that's at the end of the book) that Corrigan was his favorite character, and that, in a sense, he felt closest to him. (Corrigan is one of two brothers that the first narrative centers around.)Corrigan, of course, is, like the author, from Ireland and resides in New York for the rest of his time in the novel. After the first story, though, I felt my interest in the book shrink. I dreaded picking it up (but I had to for the event).

Perhaps the ideas weren't bad, but, as some reviewers seem to have noted, it doesn't quite feel real. A story doesn't have to be realistic for you to feel something for the characters, but I didn't feel much at all. They were all made out of paper, not flesh and bone. It was too forced, like I'd imagine bad sex to be. (Appologies for the crudeness.) I didn't finish this book, because I have other books to read and other things to do, and quite honestly it wasn't worth the time I had already spent on it.

If I hadn't gotten this for free, I'd have felt jilted after reading it; though, I'm fairly sure I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.

If you're not sure whether or not you want to buy it, go to a book store (if you can) and read a bit (keeping in mind that the first story just might be a bit more appealing than all the others) and skim through. You might be saving yourself some money and irritation.",0.9365079365079364,objective review

Alan Gordon,"November 25, 2013",2.0,"No doubt this novel is well-written but perhaps that's just the trouble with it. The author seems bent on writing somethng beautiful and profound and misses the basics like character development, for example. The whole time I'm reading about characters that I just don't care about! Why? Because I don't know them. Each vignette is told iusing a first person narrative, and in two of the three vignettes the character telling the story is so self-absorbed that the characters around them lack substance. In the first part, with the catholic priest, it's the opposite problem. The priest's brother tells the story of his eccentric Mother Theresa-type sibling who takes over the story to the point that the narrator remains flat and two-dimensional on the page. His (the narrator's) behavior is unexplainable and unpredictable because the reader doesn't know him and therefore doesn't know what to expect. Colum McCann should take heed from such wonderful novels as The Great Gasby or Netherland by joseph O'Neill both of which use a first-person narrative to develop the main character of the novel. However in both of these works those described and those describing are equally-well developed.",0.9375,objective review

jonathan briggs,"November 20, 2013",3.0,"In August 1974, Philippe Petit walked out on a tightrope stretched across the gulf between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, still under construction. Back in the days before 24-hour cable ""news"" channels, that's the kind of item that would have capped the networks' nightly news broadcasts. I can picture my dad watching and shaking his head and muttering at the screen, ""Jackass."" And that's a valid reaction. Petit is a jackass. Not only that, he's a French jackass. But sometimes, novelist Colum McCann argues, the world needs a jackass. In ""Let the Great World Spin,"" 2009's National Book Award winner, Petit plays holy fool in the lives of a handful of people -- a support group for mothers mourning sons lost in Vietnam, a pair of Scott-n-Zelda-wannabe artists, an aspiring photographer, a judge hoping to handle Petit's arraignment, a whore or two and even a gang of California hackers on the ARPANET(!). They all derive some kind of personal meaning from ""le coup"" pulled off by Petit that summer.

McCann telegraphs early that he's not afraid to embrace sentimentality: ""It is not fashionable anymore, I suppose, to have a regard for one's mother in the way my brother and I had then ... but the truth is we enjoyed each other, all three of us, and never so evidently as those Sundays when the rain fell gray over Dublin Bay and the squalls blew fresh against the windowpane."" That's a little gooey, but maybe it just strikes me that way coz of all the Sundays my brother and I used to spend in the cellar ferally fighting over scraps of beef jerky while Ma was in the kitchen upstairs gettin likkered up. Hhhhhh, sorry, I get a little weepy thinking back on those days.

McCann kicks off the story with a serious miscalculation that almost scuttles the novel. The first 70 pages -- a segment titled ""All Respects to Heaven, I Like It Here,"" about a hippie Irish priest and his stable of hookers -- read like a novella written at the beginning of McCann's career, then tucked away in a drawer after multiple rejections, then resurrected and recycled and raggedly grafted on to the front of ""Great World."" McCann has been a published novelist for more than a decade, yet this piece of writing is rife with rookie blunders, unintentional silliness and borderline-racist caricatures, culminating in a mawkish monologue that goes on unbroken for five or six pages. How did this get a National Book Award? I began to wonder if this was the literary equivalent of ""Crash"" winning the Oscar (though ""Great World"" isn't that bad). Aside from a couple of amateurish relapses, the writing does get better after that initial segment, but the book continues to frustrate because every time the story starts to work, McCann has to get cute, dropping ba-dum-bump would-be-witty one-liners such as ""Another day, another dolor."" How did he get away with ""she was a woman who had known the worst of times and best of times""? Or take this passage:

""Oh, the day Joshua first shaved! Oh, the day! Covered himself in foam. So very careful with the razor. Made an avenue through the cheek, but nicked himself on the neck. Tore off a tiny piece of his Daddy's Wall Street Journal. Licked it and pasted it to the wound. The business page clotting his blood. Walked around with the paper on his neck for an hour. He had to wet it to get it off. She had stood at the bathroom door, smiling. My big tall boy, shaving. Long ago, long ago. The simple things come back to us. They rest for a moment by our ribcages then suddenly reach in and twist our hearts a notch backward.

""No newspapers big enough to paste him back together in Saigon.""

It's a nicely detailed snapshot scene of a mother remembering her son. Then that last line lands with a thud, jarring you out of the story so you notice the director behind the curtain, trying to draw your attention in a manic tapdance, waving his arms and yelling, ""Didja see that? Didja see what I just did there?!!"" It's that artificiality and authorial unwillingness to step aside and let the story unfold naturally that hold ""Great World"" back from success. It's all a little too pat, a little too stage-managed, every story element engineered for maximum dramatic effect. Even the scuzziest aspects of New York seem like set dressing. ""That's how it is in the life, word."" No. I'm pretty certain that it's not. McCann is manipulative, but he manages to do it without being calculating, which is a skill not unworthy of respect. Dickens made a career of it. Ron Howard is a sappy filmmaker, but I can't help but like him. He's Opie. He's Richie Cunningham. Who the hell else is he gonna be? ""Great World"" has a lot in common with Howard's movies: There are sassy whores like in ""Night Shift."" There are feisty oldsters like in ""Cocoon."" There are colorful Irish immigrants like in ""Far and Away."" Someone needs to get Ron Howard a copy of this book.

Of course, McCann knows the emotional baggage the World Trade Center carries for most of us (Does anyone else get a twinge in the chest when older movies show the towers in place on New York's skyline?). He includes a photo (undoctored, I assume) of Petit's tightrope walk in which a jet flies overhead, seemingly scant feet away from one of the towers. He wants us to contrast the ""artistic crime of the 20th century"" to the monstrous crime against humanity that opened the 21st; a moment of sublime silliness juxtaposed with an act of rabid savagery. And in case anyone didn't get that, he appends a lugubrious final chapter set in 2006 that spells it all out explicitly for the slower readers. McCann mourns a country that's become stern and unyielding in its sadness. A scarred nation under draconian liquid bans where right-thinking liberals can't even make innocent jokes in airport checkpoint lines without being hauled off by humorless, snarling TSA thugs for flogging and cavity searches in a dungeon somewhere. But he sees glimmers of hope in a few New Yorkers' acts of kindness and in the Dawning of the Golden Age of Obama (did I miss something?). It's a sermon that's overstated and exaggerated like everything else in this crazily uneven novel. And in case someone still doesn't get the drift, McCann adds an Author's Note at the end to explain it all over again. And just in case there are STILL a couple of dudes scratching their heads in the back row of the special class, McCann stages an interview with his writer buddy Nathan Englander, so Englander can ask him, ""So, Colum, what's it all about?"" ""Why, Nathan, I'm so glad you happened to ask me that...""

Early on in ""Great World,"" McCann states what might as well be the book's moral: ""He said he'd rather die with his heart on his sleeve than end up another cynic."" I think I'd rather hang out with Dad and shake my head and mutter, ""Jackass.""",0.9119819819819821,objective review

"David LaRoche ""Searching for fine fiction"" (San Jose, CA United States)","November 8, 2013",5.0,"Irish, they have the gift: Beckett, Brehan Swift, Joyce, scores of scores more and now we are gifted Colum MaCann and his ""Let the Great World Spin.""

There aren't enough accolades. His writing is lyrical. It's rhythm and pace though 300 and more pages is flawless - a sonnet written in prose. The story defies imagination, is complex yet simple in understanding - a mirror in many respects, a view out in others. For a long book that goes into the soul of its characters, lays the detail of contents out like prunes in a drying shed, it is magnetic and impossible to put down.

I do a lot of reading and this novel is high on my list - perhaps on the top. If you like life, its facets, its population and circumstances, suffering into joy and joy into death, you will enjoy this book - maybe learn from it. Thank You Colum McCann

"J Swink (Watauga, TX USA)","November 4, 2013",5.0,"One of the most humane, inventive, and well-written American novels that I have read in a long time. McCann's uncanny ability to create distinct and believable voices sets this novel apart from many other post-9/11 novels. Those who appreciate the New York of Don DeLillo's novels will be pleased to discover it again, in McCann's novel, which takes place in the early 1970s before concluding in the late 2000's. While not as sweeping in scope as DeLillo's 'Underworld,' 'Let the Great World Spin' seamlessly blends historical events and place into a fictional narrative that meditates on the lives touched, and those ignored in the shadows of, the newly constructed Twin Towers.",1, failed
Dog lover,"November 2, 2013",5.0,"My all-time favourite book. It's got such a rare quality - that raw, poignant, honest subtlety that I've only seen sparingly before. It tells the story of characters caught up in addiction, love and family ties, and all are cleverly drawn together by the 'tightrope walker in the sky'. The characters are flawed, genuine, touching and very, very human, and their lives are original and intertwined, often connected by hope and the bonds between them.
It's a beautiful, powerful book with an elaborate story and I've never read anything like it.",0.9,objective review

Do we need to know what is in someone's wastepaper basket if those items don't figure in anything? There's a lot of description here of what is happening, but very little in-depth. The description of the car crash, e.g., is very precise, but so what? It reveals nothing about any of the characters involved. The author seems to think that a fatal accident is enough by itself, that being a priest, or a hooker, is enough -- but that's lazy, imo. Although stereotypes can be brought alive, these are not -- the conflicted priest, the intelligent hooker. Also, the structure is too clever by half. I have a feeling this author sat down and asked himself what would sell. Set the book in NYC, check. Use the World Trade Center at the height of its glory, check. Use a clever structure of vaguely intertwined stories, check. And it worked. The book became very popular.

Down there there are many individual stories, involuntarily and secretly tangled. As the read proceeds, we got caught in the intricate existences of some of the Acrobat's viewers. In their stories we found the real struggle, the real miracle.

John,"August 25, 2013",3.0,"McCann has some wonderful turns of phrase in this book, and is clearly a master of the English language. Based on the glowing reviews and awards, I perhaps set my expectations too high. The story is a loosely connected series of vignettes of the sleazy underbelly of New York, prostitutes and Irishmen, I suppose, being Irishmen. Oddly the story emphasizes the true story of the man who sky-walked between the twin towers, although one wonders what he has to do with the novel at all. There are extended patches of rather senseless dialogue from those who observed it as if it were the greatest event ever. Are we are really talking about blase New Yorkers? It is almost as if the author thought the event itself was worthy of a novel, but keeps the reason hidden from the reader. The author also constructs, aye, that's the proper word, quite a few convenient connections between people that are so contrived as to be a bit off-putting. Some of the characters are interesting but it really takes a John Irving to make believable connections between a tightrope-walker, a band of prostitutes, and two Irish brothers.

Billy Boy,"July 28, 2013",5.0,"Through masterful storytelling, the author of Let the Great World Spin (he's Irish of course) demonstrates how people's lives can be transformed by a singular event, which can then be a catalyst for deeper connections and life changing attitudes towards oneself and others. The event is a tightrope walk between the twin towers, a feat that captures the imagination of the entire city and hovers above the stories of the disparate people brought together by what becomes a symbolic event, foreshadowing 9/11. The book was written after that event, but pre-Anthony Weiner, and takes place mainly before it in the turbulent times of Nixon's sinking presidency.

The author skips from main character to main character, each of whom recounts his or her story in an individual voice. The threads created are wrapped up at the end in an insightful manner, consistent with each character's persona and the inevitability of life.

Could this be nominated as the definitive 9/11 book? Certainly it could be argued that 9/11 is a theme. Without the portent of the twin towers attack the tightrope walking event would not have the same impact. One senses the significance of the walk as a metaphor or perhaps a potential agent of change in the way people interconnect or are drawn together for good or bad by an external event. The literary quality of this novel would be diminished without the walk and its inherent present day associations,

Margery Leonard,"July 27, 2013",5.0,"National Book Award-winning author Colum McCann has just published his 8th book. Let the Great World Spin is his seventh. A fictional work, it has been called the most cathartic of the post-9/11 works of literature. McCann uses skillful and powerful prose to create realistic fictional characters whose lives have all been touched by violence and loss, and whose lives link together in surprising ways. The setting is New York, 1974. The novel is set in motion by a real-life New York happening--a tightrope walker who walks between the World Trade Towers. There's even a haunting photograph, showing the tightrope walker in the foreground, with a plane in the background that appears to be heading right for one of the Tower buildings. But wait! This novel is set more than a quarter century before the carnage of 9/11/2001, which is never mentioned, but that underscores the happenings in this plot.

Beth Quinn Barnard (Oregon USA),"July 6, 2013",4.0,"The optimism of Colum McCann's novel begins in the title, reminding us that the world is much more than our individual lives and its ceaseless spinning is as likely to deliver joy as it is to deliver sorrow. The story is mostly set in New York City in August 1974 when Phillipe Petit strung a wire between the towers of the World Trade Center and mesmerized much of the city 110 stories below. At that time the city was at its low point -- decrepit, bankrupt, crime-ridden -- and much of the action takes place in a Bronx Housing project where an Irish monk named Corrigan has opened his apartment to the hookers who ply their trade under the Deegan Expressay and fallen in love with a Guatemalan nurse who is the widow of a death squad officer. The monk's brother, Ciaran, arrives from Ireland and is appalled by but also drawn to two of the streetwalkers, Tillie and her 17-year-old daughter, Jazmin, who has toddler twins of her own. Across the river in Manhattan is Claire, wife of a judge and bereaved mother of a son lost in Vietnam, who has found some solace for her grief by getting to know other women whose sons died in southeast Asia. And there is Lara, a daughter of privilege and artist, who left behind drugs and alcohol when she escaped the city a year earlier but disastrously falls right back in on her first return to the city. As Petit dances across his wire, the lives of these characters collide in a tragedy, but the great world spins on, and ultimately delivers the survivors to redemption and joy.",0.45,negative review

Digital Rights (Newtown/Fairfield CT),"June 21, 2013",3.0,"Kaleidoscopes generally don't work for me. The writer needs to over invest in characters that come and go. He then must come up with some ingenious way for them to intersect, weaving a story that we both want to read and that brings the disparate group of characters in touch with each other. And then he has to find some resolution that leaves the reader somewhat satisfied but knowing you can possibly tie up all the loose ends created by so many open ended storylines.

He then needs the reader to invest in those characters only to see them fade as the next one takes the stage.

It's frankly too ambitious.

And in the the 21st century do we really need another story where the lives of street walking hookers intersect with Park Avenue's elite, Irish immigrants, pimps and judges, nurses, artists and doctors and everyone has a distinctive accent with their cultural rough edges from the new yawkah to those foreigners? Frankly ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" or any New Yorker article or novel by Tom Wolfe, George Plimpton, John Dos Passos or Jay McInerney or any next 10 great novelists of the last century have captured much of what McCann has tried to write here.

In the end the McCann tries too hard to create great characters that should fill a whole book but only hold us for a chapter or 2. Unfortunately that's near impossible to invest in them or buy into each's connection to the next person. So then you just suspend belief and take faith in the Hail Mary that's been thrown out there to try and save the story and bring it home.

The contradiction to all that is that I did like the characters but there were too many. I felt a bit shortchanged in how they quickly wrapped up. What was a story that was largely concrete ended with a bit too much metaphor and symbolism with a character, Jazzlyn, a woman we barely got to know is left to give it all meaning.

Then, the book slipped into the next character and the next and for a long time, it felt like the book was not going anywhere. Maybe the story was going, but it was not getting anywhere. Just as I started caring about what was going to happen to Tillie or Claire or Adelita or Gloria, another character stepped in. As a result, midway through, despite the poetic and startlingly beautiful language, I almost put the book down. I felt I was working my way through some interesting short stories but none of them gave me enough of any of the characters. The descriptions are uncanny, they are so perfect, the vignettes are full of interesting people, but the plot meandered. Ultimately, I discovered there really wasn't a plot. It's a very different kind of a book and is full of grief, love, healing and more emotions than I thought possible in one story, but I did feel l was left hanging with the snippets of so many characters' lives starting and stopping.

Katherine M Karns,"June 9, 2013",3.0,"This is a dense, thick work of poetry-prose that layers on lives and experiences. The author dives first into the lives of interconnected characters whose choices combined with chance throw them into a hell of personal tragedy or allow them to take small steps to redemption. A common thread to all the action is the tightrope walker, an actual person, and his dizzying feat of walking between the twin towers, an actual event.

The first narrator tells of his brother Corrigan who has vowed to be celibate and poor, who has chosen a life of helping the untouchable elements - the sick, aged, hookers and heroin addicts. The reader is as frustrated as the narrator with Corrigan's choices. As Corrigan makes a choice that promises to free him, by loving a woman (the nurse at the nursing home), his fate catches up to him. We also see from the hooker, Tillie's, perspective the sheer frustration of the choices she has made and her guilt at bringing her own daughter into the life of hooking and heroin. Is there a way out for these people? The author leads us through several other lives, including a Judge Soderberg, who sees cases of both the hookers and the tightrope walker in one day, and Claire, his affluent wife, who befriends Gloria, the woman from the projects who stepped in to care for the Tillie's grandchildren - their common bond being the loss of sons in Vietnam but their continuing friendship a flickering light of hope for the future.

McCann's ambitious effort to get into the heads of these diverse characters is an attempt to get at the human condition. The characterization flows naturally for some characters (such as Corrigan's brother) but is less natural and more superficial for those who are probably further from McCann's experience, such as the hooker and the judge. Reading their stories I want to laugh or cry, but I still don't know what really makes them tick. (And maybe that's the point.)

From the outset the characters grab you and McCann's writing pulls you in and forces you to care about them - you may not like them but you root for them nonetheless. His writing is extremely poetic and invokes more imagery - both internal and external - than almost any other author I've read.

Thomas Moody,"May 8, 2013",5.0,"In a work of fiction marvelously engulfing the 1974 World Trade Center Towers tightrope walk by Frenchman Philippe Petit, Colum McCann profoundly embraces the core of humanistic existence by linking several seemingly obscure characters into one very touching and literarily cohesive unit with ""Let The Great World Spin."" With great care and precision, McCann unpacks each character's story with such erudite grace and detail while centering each, in one way or another, around this historic event. I found myself again and again amazed at the fluidity of his writing and character depiction while following the plot to a rather forlorn conclusion.

We're introduced to New York City circa 1974, mainly in Manhattan and the Bronx, peopled with characters as diverse and interesting as a reluctant Irish monk and the throng of prostitutes that he attempts to protect. We also follow the story of a group of middle-age women whose main hostess has a rather disgruntled local judge for a husband. We meet hippie artists and telephone hackers and, my favorite, a subway rider whose main purpose is to search out the new ""tags"" and ""blowups"" in the subway terminals that the local graffiti artists have rendered.

All of these seemingly disparate people are connected to the tightrope walker and McCann's ability to dissect their lives, for all their banality, is only overshadowed by the strength of tone he presents. His writing is lyrical when required and profoundly ""street"" at others...an amazing contrast. And, antipathetic to most character driven narratives, this work comes with a strong plot that reaches a heartfelt and sad conclusion. There were episodes within this work that bore reading over and over...the writing and structure are that good.

Schmadrian,"April 24, 2013",4.0,"I recently read Molly Ringwald's book 'When It Happens To You; A Novel in Stories'. (And reviewed it here on Amazon.) So a comparison between that work and this one was screaming out to be had.

I have (an admittedly arbitrary) way of looking at different craftspeople.

There are vocalists...and then there are singers.

There are guitar players...and then there are guitarists.

There are people who write...and then there are writers.

Molly Ringwald is a person who writes. Colum McCann is a writer.

Both of them have taken short stories about an assembly of characters and woven them together. 'Overlap' is the theme of the day.

I believe Mr. McCann succeeds in telling a good story more than Ms Ringwald. (Although I don't believe the device served even his tale well. Oh, and I could have done without almost all the material about the two Irish brothers in NYC.)

He certainly has more chops; I think there were a tiny handful of sections in hers where I sat back in admiration, whereas his contained all kinds of gems. (A couple of them were stellar, reminiscent of Frank DeLillo's beaut, the opening forty-or-so pages of 'Underworld'.)

"Lewis M. Weinstein (Key West, FL)","April 7, 2013",3.0,"It is beautifully structured and written but oh, so depressing. All of the characters are leading a life that is surely precariously balanced on a high wire of their own making.

But ... The author challenged himself with a literary walk on the high wire, and in my view did not make it to the other side. The story is not told in a linear fashion. The time frame jumps forward and backward as often as the point-of-view character changes. As other GR readers have said, it is more a series of somewhat linked short stories than it is a novel.

Almost every new scene was confusing and, to me, irritating. Who is this unnamed person? Where does he/she fit? Is this event happening before or after the last time we met this character? Even if this confusion was resolved within a page or two, it nevertheless unbalanced the flow of my reading. By the time that flow was reestablished, the scene was over and another scene created a new disruption.

The lack of a single protagonist to carry the emotion of the story made the unsettling disruptions worse. Every time I began to feel something, the story line and character which had evoked those feelings disappeared and the emotion dissipated. I could never really settle in to enjoy the story. Was this the author's intent?

A clue to this intent is found in the interview with the author at the end of the book. ""Did you envision the whole plot of this book in advance?"" he is asked. McCann answers, ""I just got happily lost over and over again! It's a fairly intricate maze, but I never mapped it out, it just kept unfolding for me. There were times I didn't feel like I was writing it at all. I was being blown around by twelve different voices.""

The result of this haphazard approach was unsatisfying for me. Some confusion is fine, but I don't like a book totally structured that way. Had the high wire guy prepared in that manner, he would never have gotten to the top of the towers, and would surely have fallen off if he had.

My conclusion: many pieces of ""Let The Great World Spin"" were well researched and beautifully told, but for me the whole was less than its parts. It's hard to decide when there are such disparate elements, but I end up with 3*.",0.9493333333333333,objective review
"Richard Bon (Philadelphia, PA)","April 3, 2013",4.0,"As someone originally from NYC, I'm shocked and a bit embarrassed that I'd never heard of the famous 1974 Philippe Petit walk between the unfinished World Trade Center towers before reading this book. The event itself, around which the action of the book indirectly revolves, fascinated me as I read, and for this I'm indebted to Colum McCann.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story and McCann's depiction of The Big Apple during a difficult time in its history. The characters were interesting and engaging and the way in which most of them were connected, with and without regard to the Petit walk, came together very naturally and effectively.

I would've given this book 5 stars if not for two small complaints:

1) Two of the middle chapters, in my opinion, could've been omitted. One follows a teenage photographer as he attempts to time shots of underground graffiti while riding the subway, the other a group of west coast kids who learn of Petit's walk when they randomly call pay phones near the WTC. I think McCann included the former to further show what life was like at the time for low income NYC teens, and the latter to highlight the lack of technology at the time, the relative slowness with which information spread compared to today's world? But I think the book would've been better without these chapters, cleaner, because these characters stood alone, whereas the others were connected somehow in addition to everyone's connection with Petit's walk.

2) Perhaps if I were reading this book for the first time in, say, 2025, I would like the part where McCann fast forwards to 2006. But reading it in 2011 like I did, I found myself wishing he'd just left all of the action in 1974.

A final note: reading McCann's description of the Petit walk itself, I felt as if I were standing on the edge of one of the towers myself, afraid I might fall. Masterful is the word that comes to mind when I think of the way those parts are written.",0.9166666666666667,objective review

Book Dork (Southern California),"March 10, 2013",5.0,"Within the first few pages of starting this novel I knew that it was going to be good. It had the big three- characters, story, and writing.

The Characters
- The way McCann connects his characters is both subtle and obvious at the same time. I always wonder about minor characters, what they back stories are, and how they became the way they are. This book provides that information, taking seemingly small characters from other points in the book and then making them the focus for a later chapter.
- The characters are so very damaged. Hookers, mothers of dead sons, a struggling religious zealot, to name a few. Through this struggle they bond and learn how to survive.

The Story
- Everyone in this novel is connected, in some way, by a man who is walking on a tightrope between the Twin Towers, most of which have just seen him.
- There's no true whole plot, just a lot of stories- and that's okay. There doesn't need to be a beginning and an end.

My main complaint is that there is little drama at the end, no real climax. The story peters out, and some of the tales continue and some come to a plaintive end. They all revolve, in some way, around the tight-roper between the World Trade Center, but that feels more like a plot device than a real focal point. It just feels forced to this reader.

I know many people loved the book. I had expected great things, and I was disappointed. Perhaps it does reveal the soul of NYC as I had read in a previous review.

M. Sanchez (Boston),"February 3, 2013",4.0,"This book was in many ways a study of beauty in the ashes - beauty that can be found in the most desolate of places, including 1970s New York City! And yet - the contrast might be especially stark there, but isn't the entire world a study in these contrasts if you look closely enough?

It is also about how we are all linked together, in part, by an appreciation of beauty and its pursuit. It was a stunningly wonderful idea to tie all the stories together with the tightrope walker, who united all New Yorkers in an extraordinary moment of awe and hush. And yet - years later, we also were all united again in a terrifying moment of anguish looking up at those same towers. United in the recognition of beauty, united in the experience of ashes and pain. In that respect, this novel is a marvelous work of poetry.

Evidence from a few characters:
""What Corrigan wanted was a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday. The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth--the filth, the war, the poverty--was that life could be capable of small beauties.""

Of paintings destroyed in the rain: ""But then I started looking through them. And they were beautiful and ruined.""

Why the walker walked: ""The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium. He felt for a moment uncreated. Another kind of awake.""

A judge assessing the city: ""Every now and then the city shook its soul out. It assailed you with an image, or a day, or a crime, or a terror, or a beauty so difficult to wrap your mind around that you had to shake your head in disbelief.""

On why a young lady kept an photo of the tightrope walk: ""The photo was taken on the same day her mother died--it was one of the reasons she was attracted to it in the first place: the sheer fact that such beauty had occurred at the same time.""

And there's more where that came from...a study of real beauty in the real world.

"Ryan ""Gen","December 22, 2012",5.0,"If you've never seen the documentary, Man on a Wire, which tells the story of Philippe Petit's illicit tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974, I recommend it highly. Let the Great World Spin isn't strictly about that event, but uses it as a lit-fic centerpiece for a set of interconnected stories and vignettes that span a cross-section of New York City at that moment in time.

Like Petit, each protagonist seems to be in the middle of his or her own balancing act, putting on a performance for the public while dealing with a private drama. There's a young Irish monk, whose ministry to the streetwalkers of the Bronx and a God he's determined to find in their lives falls somewhere between folly and true devotion. There's a group of mothers meeting for mutual support after losing their sons in Vietnam, the universality of grief contending with their vast class differences. There's a prostitute approaching forty, who has made many bad decisions, yet still has a riveting account to give of herself and her life. There's a weary city judge, caught between the opposing goals of dispensing justice and not clogging an overburdened court system. And there's Petit himself, whose walk is not a crass stunt, but appears to be a profound act of artistic purity.

In my opinion, Colum McCann does a stunning job of putting the reader inside the minds of his diverse characters. There's a real poetry and melancholy beauty to the writing, and I felt that I knew each of these people intimately in a few pages, just from the voice and a collection of small details. The talented voice actors who performed the audiobook deserve a lot of credit as well, giving McCann's prose authentic texture and tone. Not every piece works equally well -- a sequence featuring early computer hackers comes across as a little fanciful and forced -- but, mostly, I was impressed with the amount of time the author must have put into research.

Some readers feel that there isn't enough ""story"", but, to me, there didn't need to be. The vignettes themselves aren't complex, but as the book moves forward, they begin to build on one another, exploring what different perceptions people can have of the same events, and each other. I enjoy books where I get one thing out of a sequence on first read, but a different impression in light of later chapters, and this was one. Together, the individual tales imbue the space between them with an ineffable landscape of grief and redemption, time and memory.

Without a doubt, this was one of finest audiobooks I've listened to this year. It was a pleasure to soak in the voices, the sensory details, and that aching sense of a lost moment suspended in time. This is what literary fiction is about.",0.9074074074074073,objective review

I was thrilled to receive an advance reader's copy of LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN three and a half years ago but somehow it never made it to the top of my ""to be read"" pile until this week. I have always been fascinated by New York City and Irish writer Colum McCann does a good job describing both the place and the very specific time period in which the novel takes place. He tells his slice of life story from the viewpoint of several very diverse people who are somehow connected to each other on August 7, 1974 the day a young Frenchman walked across a tightrope spanning the two world trade center towers. A saintly Irish member of a religious order, his visiting brother, a couple of Bronx prostitutes, some moms mourning the losses of their sons in Viet Nam, the judge who arraigns the tightrope walker and an artist from a wealthy family who has squandered much of her twenties on drugs and wild parties are some of the most memorable characters who are all interconnected in surprising ways. McCann is able to give credible voices to these people including three African American women. I also like the way McCann uses a very specific real life incident to anchor the stories of his fictional characters. And McCann has a lot to say about social justice and problems that still exist in American society.

AvisE,"December 21, 2014",2.0,"This book suffers from the same flaws as so many of the books I've read lately. Maybe I'm just becoming ultra-critical the more I read, but there was very little in this book that worked for me.

It's so frustrating to hear over and over again that writer's need to show and not tell, only to come across award-winning books that break this cardinal rule. Let the Great World Spin provides a very good example of why it doesn't work: It's extremely tedious to read. Being a fan of 19th century fiction I have a high tolerance for detailed scene setting, subtle nuance and limited action. I don't mind lashings of backstory when it's done properly, but large portions of this book read like a first draft.

I love that the author was trying to portray an iconic event in New York city history from many different perspectives, showing the diversity and also the connections between characters from vastly different backgrounds. He also touches on contemporary issues in the wake of September 11. Unfortunately the characters were flat and stereotypical for me. Flicking from one perspective to the next did not allow me to connect with any of them in a significant way. Despite the detailed descriptions, the portrayal of New York city didn't feel authentic and I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated as I went along. The connections between characters seemed contrived and I got a strong sense that the writer had no real plan for the ending as it just got thinner and thinner and petered out.

It's about New York City in the grander perspective, probably why it was honored with a National Book Award. And it's written disjointedly, in the stylish structure of Jonathan Franzen, David Foster Wallace, and Thomas Pynchon. Another thing in its favor in the book award sweepstakes.

It begins with an Irish man looking for his brother in New York, the brother some sort of sidewalk saint, who, well, does what he can for the down and out. In an out of this story walk many characters: several hookers, some office workers, a Guatemalan nurse, a judge, and a high-wire daredevil, to name a few. The book's coherence, as much as it exists, concerns a man walking a tightrope between the two World Trade Centers, as New York collectively looks on. Incidentally, McCann's dialogue between the watchers is some of the most vivid I've read, and that's definitely a compliment. Imagining this guy's high wire act almost gave me vertigo.

McCann juggles his memorable characters admirably, his dialogue is taut and evocative, and his prose often sparkles. The pitfalls with this sort of story are those of coherence and detail. His strung-together story often hangs by a thread, but in the end, he makes it work. Still, all too often there are details to the book's goings-on, to the characters' lives that take us nowhere but deeper into minutiae.

Colum McCann's ""Let the Great World Spin"" is a greatly accomplished novel, as the cover blurb is eager to point out. Yet it's also one of those melancholic books that I was mentioning just before.

The language is beautiful, and if write this too often is simply because I tend to read beautifully-written novels, the plot is engaging but...everything is sad and it eventually made me think about so many novels of this kind and, conversely, so few of the happy-variety, ultimately get awards. Of course McCann isn't to be blamed, he just happened to be the tipping point in my thinking.

""Let The Great World..."" is about several interlocking narratives, all of which are set in 1974, when Philippe Petit, a French tighrope walker, famously crossed the empty space between the Twin Towers.

Unfortunately, as a veteran who has friends that served in Vietnam, I stopped reading when Mr. McCann introduced a character who was supposedly stationed in country by orders of the president to get accurate number counts for our dead by computer hacking. US fighting forces have a history dating back to the Civil War that we don't leave our dead behind. That tradition, along with payroll records, pretty much gives a good number count for our casualties. Additionally, McCann has his character take frequent trips outside to cool off from working on the computer equipment room. Having worked for a mainframe computer company in the '70's, and subsequently installed and maintained control equipment for decades, the one place a body can be sure to cool off is the equipment room. There,temperatures are kept cool and brisk to prevent equipment from overheating! Here's one last fine point, the Communications people in Vietnam usually maintained equipment in special truck convoys -- to keep mobile and to control the temperature with aux generators.

Great works of fiction are great because real people can relate to the environment and circumstances of the story.

This book only spends a little time on the whole tightrope walker episode. Most of the time you are learning about a complex group of characters trying to survive tough times in New York's worst neighborhoods. The choices they make and the lives they live are not preferred, wanted, or what we typically call normal. However, they are struggling as best they can.

Reading this book is a bit painful. The situations described, the decisions the characters make are very real. It is almost as if this were a documentary. The more you learn about each character, the more you want to know. The writing it very good and the characters are deep, wide, and believable.

o excellent character building

Let the Great World Spin is one of my favorite books for several reasons. The way it is written is highly engaging. McCann leaves the readers hanging in suspense on countless occasions - much like the man on the tightrope - with dangerous moves and twists and turns. It also adopts quite a few different points of view from many of the characters that play important roles, and even perspectives of some of the more minor characters. I felt this style of writing was very unique from what I was used to reading, and I found it almost refreshing as a change of pace from some of the more mundane works.

0,"March 4, 2012",3.0,"""The watchers below pulled in their breath all at once. The air felt suddenly shared. The man above was a word they seemed to know, though they had not heard it before."" (p. 7)

The watchers in Colum McCann's ""Let the Great World Spin"" are New Yorkers, heads turned heavenward, eyes fixed on Philippe Petit as he eases out onto a wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Crazy man? Lunatic? Jokester? Will he jump? Or fall? No one knows. And as everyone wonders, the city holds its collective breath, watches and waits.

It is the mid 1970s. The Twin Towers are a marvel in themselves. Nearly a quarter of a mile high, they were the tallest buildings in the world from '71 to '73. No one would have guessed the fate that awaited thirty years down the road.

McCann uses Petit's high wire act as the thread that weaves through this collection of linked stories. Petit remains, simply, an unnamed aerialist so dedicated to his exquisite art form that he needs little else to thrive. His grace and control are balletic. His body is a supple, sinewy extension of his beautiful imagination. He is an enigmatic and fascinating character.

McCann spends far too little time on Petit and far too much time on characters like Corrigan and his narrator brother, Ciaran, two young Irishman trying to make a difference to the down and outers who work the streets of New York and live off them as well. Corrigan's martyrdom is tiresome. Ciaran seems to be an appendage, there to narrate and nothing more. At some point, I began to feel bogged down by their shared history.

There are other players; a mother who grieves for the son killed in Viet Nam, her husband, the judge who gets the case involving the wire walker, Tillie, a suicidal hooker who worked the streets with her seventeen year-old-daughter, a group of California computer geeks patched into a payphone on the street below the towers, and in 2006, Tillie's granddaughter Jaslyn, who finds a photo of the man on the tightrope and reflects on what things might have been like decades before.

As much as I wanted to, I never fully dropped into the ""Great World"" of this story. Some of the stories spin. Others sputter. Several tie together. A few characters come on stage briefly, then disappear; the computer geeks, the graffiti photographer, feeling more like asides that could have been edited out. McCann fully inhabits his characters, giving each a distinctive voice. I especially enjoyed Tillie's tragic voice and Jude Soderberg's unsentimental view of the justice system and the people, losers and lovers and everyone in between, who pass through its endlessly revolving door. McCann transitions smoothly between first and third person, though some passages get a little sing-songy with the word play and are awkward and over-stylized. The ending feels tacked on. The novel works well as a whole, though I never stopped feeling these were short-stories. Not a bad thing, just something I was conscious of.",0.8333333333333334,objective review

0,"January 16, 2012",1.0,"I got the distinct impression that author McCann was trying to pull off what Michael Cunningham succeeded in pulling off with his tour de force, ""The Hours"": three stories revolving around one (in that case, Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, ""Mrs. Dalloway."")

Where Cunningham succeeded brilliantly, McCann simply falls flat. His choice of centerpiece character, Philip Petit, who tightrope-walked between the Twin Towers in August 1974, seems strained and odd because so many of his references suggest to the reader that he is in fact hinting at 9/11. It's a strange balancing act because he tries too hard to make the former as powerful as the latter, and it doesn't work.

The biggest problem is the tedious inner dialogue of each character, none of whom are tied together until the end -- by which time many have been more or less forgotten by the reader because there was never enough to hold them together in the first place. However, if the reader can hold on long enough, there is a modicum of closure in the denouement.

Ironically, the most satisfying part of the book is, in fact, not part of the novel at all. It is the first page and half of the Reader's Guide, ""Walking an Inch Off the Ground,"" where McCann recalls briefly the story of his father-in-law making it out of the North Tower on 9/11 and wading home through the dust and mayhem to McCann's apartment uptown.

When I read this portion, I admit I felt a little smug, having guessed that 9/11 was indeed the inspiration for this novel. In fact, those few sentences are riveting, proof that McCann doesn't need to impress us with how many words he can type. It's too bad he didn't stick with his initial impulse and develop a story around that Twin Towers event instead of drumming up a peculiar, run-on and decidedly self-conscious series of ""voices"" that simply bore with their own dull theatrics.",0.8928571428571429,objective review
0,"November 25, 2011",4.0,"The tie that binds the characters in Let the Great World Spin is a daring (and illegal) stunt in which a man walked on a tightrope strung between the Twin Towers in 1974.

The chapters focus on different characters but they do connect up to each other so it feels more liked linked vignettes than short stories.

I'm landing back on my 3.5 star rating here, rounding up to 4. I enjoyed the book. I think it is natural in this type of novel to find some characters more compelling than others and I did sometimes regret not spending more time with some of them.

And all of this brought together, holding its breath, as a French tightrope walker prances his way, a quarter of a mile high, between the World Trade Towers.

I almost put the book down after reading the first section about the tightrope walker. It is slow and needlessly verbose. Ditto the third portion, ""Miro, Miro, on the Wall"" about Claire on Park Avenue. I'm glad I continued reading. The rest of the book is much better.

McCann manages to string together a tightrope walker, an Irish self-styled monk and his brother, mother & daughter prostitutes and the daughter's children, a Jewish judge and his non-Jewish wife who live in a penthouse on Park Avenue, a health care worker, a support group of mothers who lost a child in the Vietnam war, and two artists, in a skillfully believable way. The reader encounters a complex of emotions - guilt, grief, frustration, love, shattered idealism, self-centered ambition - as these characters travel their various connecting paths.

Different sections are written from the point of view of the various characters, so style varies accordingly. I sometimes find that books written in this ""jump around"" technique distance me from the characters so I don't care about any of them, but that did not happen with this book. Part of McCann's skill is that the sequence fits together like pieces of a puzzle. I was ready for each section as it came to build on the whole.

Overall, the book is well-written with a cast of interesting characters. Having lived through the 70s and grown up in north Jersey where I frequently hopped a bus into Manhattan for various events, I enjoyed the look back.

Another review called it 'lyrical', and I would say that that is appropriate. But with each different voice used, he must use a different kind of poetic voice. In that sense, McCann does a good job of capturing the inner moments and quiet moments that are better captured in books than in films.

The novel is constructed as a series of interconnected short stories, some with more connection than others, involving various people in New York that witness the walk, again with varying degrees of involvement. It's a sort of New York Stories meets Six Degrees of Separation, and herein lies part of the problem with the book for me..it has a movie feel to it. Some of the prose is lovely, and some of the stories are interesting, while others are just a chronicle of events and I had little interest in them.

To put it lightly this book is a mild torture. It is melancholic throughout its entirety and really makes a point of all the bad that exists in the world.

0,"August 23, 2011",5.0,"This book is remarkable. It's hard to write an original review of a National Book Award-winning book that has been critically lauded by the New York Times Book Review, Dave Eggers, and Frank McCourt, among others. What can I bring to the table, two years after its original release? So this is just my attempt to collect my thoughts.

First of all, I've never read a novel by Colum McCann before. I think he's a genius. He wrote a post-9/11 novel that is set in 1974. Amazing. So many of the lines in the novel, especially descriptions of the Twin Towers, resonate in a haunting way, even without heavy-handed foreshadowing. Instead, McCann reminds us what New York is, was, and can be in the face of beauty and tragedy.

The organization of the novel is a mosaic of characters, moving through vignettes that eventually all connect. (Strangely, the novel I started immediately after this one, The Imperfectionists, functions in almost the same way.) Book 1, Book 2, and Book 3 are each composed of three stories each, set in 1974, punctuated between books by descriptions of the tightrope walker Phillippe Petit. Book 4 is the only one set after 9/11, and this is the book in which all the characters' stories intertwine. Though the characters range from an Irish monk to Bronx prostitutes to an upper-east side WASP, none of them ring false. McCann brings raw honesty and authenticity to all his characters, and even women narrators read true (something rare in men's writing, in my opinion).

I unhesitatingly recommend this book to anyone.

Some notable quotes:

""I gave them all of the truth and none of the honesty."" (p. 303)

""Recklessness and freedom--how did they become a cocktail?"" (p. 263)

""Even if people laughed at the notion of goodness, if they found it sentimental, or nostalgic, it didn't matter--it was none of those things, he said, and it had to be fought for."" (p. 145)",0.9413333333333334,objective review
0,"August 22, 2011",2.0,"Let me just say that there's no question that Colum McCann is a gifted writer. His use of sensory imagery rates up there with the best, and he should be given all the plaudits he can get for that. Sometimes, though, he certainly does stumble over a sentence or two in the book, and those moments do stand out. That isn't a huge problem, though. Many books have the occasional head-scratcher moment that seems out of step within context.
On the downside, this book reeks of pretension. Sure, it was released to the fanfare of the literary world, but I just can't seem to get into it. From the opening vignette placing special importance on Allen Ginsberg's Howl (a wonderful poem) throughout the rest of the book, McCann just seemed to reference things that were far beyond the scope of this book and are lightyears ahead in terms of quality.
Furthermore, I wish McCann would remove himself completely from the book, instead of popping up every now and then. It seems out of place with the book and does not contribute. In addition, the disjointed narrative seems, as a whole, annoying instead of edifying. I'm no stranger to multiple narratives; Thomas Pynchon is my favorite author, and there are many movies that I love which feature numerous excursions from the realm of traditional storytelling. However, in all of those examples, the multiple narratives provide depth to a wide cast of characters. Even in Coffee & Cigarettes, the Jim Jarmusch film, there is the unifying idea of the benefit of conversations held over the titular ""meal"", as well as the glorification of the average person, equating them with celebrities. In this book, the multiple narratives seem to exist only to add exponentially more platitudes and cliches about beauty in decay and life on a tightrope.
In summary, while this book may be gorgeously written, its in-your-face-here-I-am-LOOK-AT-ME symbolism and pretentious nature make it tinny, flat, and annoying. Colum McCann would do better to work on the depth of his narratives instead of flexing his prose muscles.

Also, for the record, anyone who likes this style of writing and would like a challenging and rewarding book should check out Thomas Pynchon's first novel, V. In my opinion, that novel is the perfect ""New York novel"" because it is the most like New York: sprawling, global, bizarre, and a testament to the profane and everyday man.",0.9509803921568628,objective review

0,"July 30, 2011",4.0,"There is a kernel of truth in this book, like an apricot with a seed around which the juicy fruit clings. The true part is the daring tightrope display by Philippe Petit between the World Trade Center towers on August 7, 1974. There are a couple of chapters about how Petit might have prepared for the feat, and in some way or another all the main characters relate to the events of that day in New York City.

But the juicy part of the book is the characters and their various intertwined stories. This book has a format popular with current writers--chapters are short stories told from different points of view. (The Imperfectionists: A Novel and A Visit from the Goon Squad are two others.) The reader has to remember details hidden along the path of the book to make sense of the plot. Time, point of view, and characters, are all changing throughout the book. As a result, this book may be too challenging for the Attention Deficit Disorder crowd, or even for serious readers who can only afford to read in short interrupted segments.

It isn't a perfect book. I hated an early chapter about siblings growing up in Ireland. And considering the author is Irish, that wasn't a promising start. McCann makes characters in New York--men, women, rich, poor, black, white, young, old--much more interesting and believable. I am not convinced a couple of chapters belong in the book--the characters seem too loosely connected to the plot, and were just not compelling.

But, I loved the book. The story that emerges (after you've put together the scattered clues) is heartbreaking and ennobling. Frequently the language McCann uses and particularly the final chapter where the narrator finds meaning to life, is pure poetry.",1.0,objective review

0,"June 22, 2011",3.0,"The theme of this novel is a high wire walk between the two tallest WTC towers in 1974. Between well-researched descriptions of the walker's preparation and the walk itself there are stories about various fictional characters from the same time. The author's own tale of arriving from Ireland and living in New York in the early 70s also forms a part.

What I found reading this was that the narrative didn't seem believable. They're fictional characters of course, but I didn't find they were representative in that too many were prostitutes or criminals. It's a really negative image that's depicted of that society. Also, the way the author arrives at the airport and drives to the Bronx and almost immediately becomes a confidante of prostitutes just isn't credible. He has all the acculturated language too: speaking about housing projects, hookers and switchblades on his first day. He's a ready-made New Yorker without any learning time in his new society. I didn't find this convincing and skipped a lot of pages.

The author has a poetic turn of phrase which can be interesting and thought-provoking but is a bit trying when overdone. His description of the walker's preparation is very effective though. He really captures the walker's mental outlook which involves finding his centre and keeping himself in balance by moving various muscles. At one point he has a wire strung over deep snow, sees a coyote watching him, falls in the snow and struggles to escape, all the time imagining thawing out in the spring for the same coyote to eat him. This is very imaginative writing.

This book has won a lot of awards. But my verdict is that he tries too hard and the story doesn't hold together. I never really understood the connection between the lives of the fictional characters and the high wire walk. Read it and wonder what it takes to win big writing awards, but don't expect too much.

0,"June 19, 2011",5.0,"Colum McCann's ""Let the Great World Spin"" just won the prestigious and lucrative IMPAC Prize, after already winning the National Book Award, and it's hard to imagine a more deserving book. ""Let the Great World Spin"" is a novel set at the time of Philippe Petit's real-life tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in August 1974, with the walk itself as its centerpiece. In structure, it is a series of interconnected short stories, with a recurring cast of wildly disparate characters who nevertheless share connections and destinies, sometimes in ways they cannot even guess. Its structure is similar to that of ""Trainspotting,"" ""Three Junes,"" or ""The Imperfectionists;"" if you disliked those books, you probably won't like ""Let the Great World Spin."" But if you did like them, ""Let the Great World Spin"" is the best of them all, combining an elegant and varied prose style, superb dialogue, and characters of almost Dickensian vividness.

Throughout the novel lies McCann's unspoken but aching question: are our lives controlled by blind fate, by divine providence, or by a combination of forces? McCann never tips his hand as to his own beliefs, and his characters range from the deep, mystical faith of Corrigan, a young Irish monk who ministers to the hookers and low-lifes of the Bronx, to the secular outlook of Gloria, who mourns the son she lost in Vietnam. But McCann leaves readers with an overwhelming sense of our shared humanity, and with the simple, pristine goodness of showing love and concern for each other. He is aided in this goal by his remarkable ability to enter the minds of his protagonists, such as his description of Petit's thoughts as he begins his walk: ""The core reason for it all was beauty. Walking was a divine delight. Everything was rewritten when he was up in the air. New things were possible with the human form. It went beyond equilibrium. He felt for a moment uncreated. Another kind of awake.""",0.9,objective review

0,"May 21, 2011",5.0,"Words exist to communicate. They carry an idea from one brain to another. Sometimes they are not very good at their job. For example, sometimes we are left guessing just exactly what someone meant when they said, ""We all know what the problem is here.""

But other times words are incredibly efficient--for example, when someone yells ""Fire!"" and everyone runs out of the building. In this particular instance, that one word carries a lot of information. It manages to say, ""To all of you who can hear me right now, there is a fire in this structure. It is a dangerous thing. If you can hear me you should get out of this structure as quickly as you can. You should also tell others of this danger."" As a ratio of meaning to words, ""Fire!"" packs quite a wallop.

On the train on the way to Philadelphia today I finished reading Colum McCann's kick-in-the-stomach collection of interconnected short stories called Let the Great World Spin. It got me thinking about words and their efficiency. Edgar Allen Poe had a theory about short stories. He believed that a short story should be about one precise feeling or effect and every word in the story should contribute to that effect. Even the most lyrical and beautiful of sentences should be cut if it got in the way of the feeling the author hoped to create in the reader's soul.

Somehow, in his 349-page collection of eleven stories centered on the true-life walk of Philippe Petit from one of the World Trade Center towers to the other on an August morning in 1974, Colum McCann manages the literary equivalent of yelling ""Fire!"" Taken as a whole, the stories of the twelve characters in Let the Great World Spin manage to convey the full range of what it means to be a thinking, feeling human in the world. This book is miraculous.

It is one of the most efficient books I have ever read. The meaning-to-word ratio is huge. Some of my favorite sentences are below:

""No shame in saying that I felt a loneliness drifting through me. Funny how it was, everyone perched in their own little world, with the deep need to talk, each person with their own tale, beginning in some strange middle point, then trying so hard to tell it all, to have it all make sense, logical and final.""

""I guess this is what marriage is, or was, or could be. You drop the mask. You allow the fatigue in. You lean across and kiss the years because they're the things that matter.""

""She likes the people with the endurance to tolerate the drudge, the ones who know that pain is a requirement, not a curse.""

""The only thing worth grieving over, she said, was that sometimes there was more beauty in this life than the world could bear.""

And sometimes more pain. And somehow Colum McCann has taken both--as well as everything in between--and put it to just the right words to say it all. And more.

""The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough.""

0,"May 6, 2011",4.0,"I had seen The Great World Spin pop up in just about every book store and on a number of ""great books"" lists for about a year, so when I found it cheap, I picked it up. Of course, I didn't actually read it for about six months, but after finishing it, I wish I had gotten to it sooner. I really, really liked this book. It so well-written - the style is beautiful, I connected with the characters, and the delicate weaving of all the plot lines was perfect. It was just a lovely book.

The unifying event in Let the Great World Spin is a fictionalization of Philippe Petit's infamous tightrope walk between the World Trade Towers in the 1970's. ""Unifying"" might not be completely accurate - Petit's tightrope walk is a tool used to introduce a variety of the characters, but it's not Petit or his act that brings them all together. On that day, most of them just happen to cross paths, but as the city and life move on from Petit's tightrope walk, all of the characters' stories start to come together naturally anyways.

The book really begins as a series of short stories. Each chapter focuses on a different character and is told in that character's voice. At first, each chapter doesn't seem to have much to do with the next, however, as you move through the book, the stories and characters start to come together and you start to see how people who really shouldn't have anything to do with each other end up being tied to each other by very random acts.

As I got deeper and deeper into Let the Great World Spin, Petit and his tightrope dropped to the background - he was interesting, but was really just a sideshow to each of the characters and stories. I couldn't get enough of the characters McCann crafted, which is a little strange to say because most, if not all, of them do not have easy or happy stories. The tone of this book is melancholy, but it is real and eventually satisfying. Despite being centered around a pretty unbelievable event, the stories and characters are believable and very relatable. There's a lot to the stories in this book - it's definitely worth digging into.

0,"May 2, 2011",5.0,"A rollicking, expansive, generous and kind-hearted novel. I was never an earnest enough English student to read any Dickens that wasn't assigned, but Colum McCann's fine, fine work reminded me most of those I did enjoy.

At the top of the heap are the wonderful characters: distinctive, honest, flawed, emotional and true. Zigging from the tightrope walker who crossed via cable 110 stories in the air between the two World Trade Center towers thirty years ago, then zagging to a humble Irish covert priest working with ladies of the street in the Bronx, he gathers a Park Avenue socialite into a group of grieving moms for their sons who lost their lives in the jungles of Vietnam War, and a half dozen others into the bountiful mix.

As Colum reveals ourselves in the mirrors of those who people the pages, he does so kindly...which is a balancing act as the acts of contrition collide with humans' baser appetites, i.e., for sex, drugs, booze, celebrity or money. But love does win out in the end, although its mettle is tested virtually every step.

There isn't any other book I've read in the last decade, if not the last two or three, that so masterfully captures social strata with a human wink and other embellishments of folly and fondness. And when the last page is turned, and the reader reflects on the whole, more and more facets of our errant beliefs pop up. In the face of humble heroes and the brutally honest self-assessment of hookers (although their actions often tumble down like their drawers), after reading this slice of life in NYC, one feels oddly redeemed.

The genius touch was using the tightrope walker as the character that connects all the other stories together. He briefly opens each section and also acts as the common thread (no pun intended) in tying the characters together. Befitting his training, he lightly and exquisitely creates a fleeting, haunting, perilous but perfectly-in-control image against the sky. Also, with a whisper, he foreshadows briefly the actions that seized the world's attention at the same spot three decades later. A brilliant metaphoric lightning rod - thank goodness, although he considers what that might all mean, not a literal one.

It's not a fast read, but at the same time, not a laborious endeavor either. I was more than willing to slow down and let the story tick along because of Colum's wonderful wordsmithing. I wish I could read it all again for the first time.",0.9351851851851851,objective review

Colum McCann can write and he does it well here. But this book seems more like a writing class assignment than anything else. I give him credit for taking ten or so different characters and giving them not only their own voice but their own distinctive writing style. And like most literary novelists, he leaves no stone unturned, letting us the reader know everything about these individual characters. Unfortunately, that does not make for a good read. So, not only is there nothing moving this book along, not only is there not a central beloved character in the absence of a central plot, but the book has both no relevance to the world today, because it's set in the '70's, nor to itself. The characters have the thinnest of connections to each other and barely share the same overriding background: the highwire tightrope from one twin tower to the other by Philippe Petit.

0,"April 13, 2011",5.0,"How do you eulogize the World Trade Center towers without the overpowering connotations of 9/11 drowning everything else that may be said? For who - at least in New York City - doesn't have particular memories or personally know someone who either died there or was one of its lucky survivors?

Yet they remain such a icon to that day of horror. They deserve to have better times re-associated with them. Author Colum McCann thought so too, and set about writing a masterpiece with a dozen voices and a cross-section of people of New York City when those towering skyscrapers were quietly providing visitors and office workers an overview to the city's angst and bustle below.

McCann uses the unexpected and thrilling tightrope walk of Philippe Petit who on a summer's day in 1974 walked, ran, and did acrobatics for a generous amount of time while spectators watched breathlessly below and policemen did - what could they do? watched and cajoled him to come in from the towers' windows on both sides. And he did - when he was ready.

The tightrope walk becomes a loosely connecting event for the vibrant characters in this novel, characters which include prostitutes, pimps, clergy, phone hackers, artists, judges, nurses and a support group of grieving mothers of fallen Vietnam vets, from Park Avenue to those that live along the Bronx' Deegan Expressway; grief is a central theme of this book - a couple main characters are killed in a vehicle crash early on - the collective grief a shadow for the looming end day of the towers. McCann shows us the city's un-pretty underside, the cynicism of over-worked and falling apart institutions and people who fight back and make do. At the same time he shows those making sacrifices and stretching their souls and learning that doing the right thing has its own merits.

This is about (as McCann said in the book's notes): ""the ordinary people on the street, the ones who walked a tightrope just one inch off the ground.""

As I was reading this remarkable book I couldn't help drawing parallels with another book about a different city, Dublin, centered around a single day decades ago - Joyce's Ulysses. Although McCann's Let the Great World Spin pivots around the tightrope day, it covers more time, and yet our author for me has caught his respective city's life - its vibrancy - with greater poignancy and clarity than the famed earlier author.

0,"March 10, 2011",4.0,"This novel by Colum McCann exemplifies the true spirit of New York City. It is a well-written and brilliant portrait of New York. As McCann travels through various personalities, he manages to tie them together by seemingly mundane actions. The raw emotions of New Yorkers, from a Park Avenue judge to prostitutes in the Bronx, capture the true chaotic essence of the city. Through his use of multiple characters, settings, and narration styles, McCann unveils different aspects of New York in every chapter. Each story and perspective happens in what feels like an eerie parallel universe with intertwining events which hold the stories together at the edges. ""It had never occurred to me before but everything in New York is built upon another thing, nothing is entirely by itself, each thing is as strange as the last, and connected"" (pg. 306). McCann successfully shows me a complex and intimately connected New York City landscape.
I appreciate McCann's efforts to apply a ""six degrees of separation"" aspect to his novel, yet it is occasionally overbearing. At the core of the novel, a tightrope walker walks between the World Trade Center towers and he inevitably affects each person in the world below him. Judge Soloman, who tries the walker in court, doesn't think about the act in the same manner as his wife Claire, or as the walker himself does. To Soloman, the verdict regarding the tightrope walker is a huge deal. His appreciation for the walker doesn't end at the successful court day it handed to him; he also acknowledges the art that the tightrope walker managed to present. ""He had made himself into a statue, but a perfect New York one, a temporary one, up in the air, high above the city. A statue that had no regard for the past.... So brash. So glassy. So forward-looking"" (pg. 248). However, to an isolated couple who live in a cabin, a fleeting newspaper article is the most they see of the act.
Although the various perspectives make the novel stronger, some snippets of seemingly meaningless stories are included as well. Hackers from California, who ""view"" the tightrope walker through calls to pay phones in New York, merely shows the chaos of the city without their actually being there. I didn't fully grasp why that story is strewn into the mix, and it took a little while to fully recognize the voice of that particular chapter. Occasionally, it took a few pages of each new chapter to identify the narrator and the storyline behind voice, which in turn led to me missing some of the key thoughts--I ended up skimming certain details which I didn't know were crucial until I uncovered this voice of the chapter. This, however, also made me reread parts of chapters, which aided my overall comprehension and appreciation of the novel.
Another aspect of this novel that I didn't like included the fact that I resonated with some of the storylines more than others. The novel discusses two brothers' childhoods in Ireland, a monk Corrigan and his more sensible brother Ciaran, and McCann practically ""raises"" them throughout the beginning of the novel. The brothers end up in the Bronx and we travel through their lives alongside them. I felt as I had more desire to read and understand Corrigan and Ciaran than other characters because McCann discusses both their childhood and adulthood, and also because Ciaran contributes to a significant amount of narration--something that the other characters are missing. However, this storyline fades as the novel continues, which I disliked.
This novel's depth is truly outstanding. It incorporates a multitude of views on New York, from the Twins Towers representing ""...the sky, the night, the colors: progress, beauty, capitalism"" (pg. 248) to the evils of the city, where ""Hooking was born in [Tillie]. That's no exaggeration"" (pg. 199). Although the connections among portraits are sometimes obscure and only apparent to the reader, I believe that McCann successfully reveals demographic diversity at its best, and at its worst.",0.8819444444444443,objective review
HG Beast,"March 10, 2011",4.0,"Let the Great World Spin, by Colum McCann, was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in recent memory. This quick-paced book, that chronicles the lives of twelve distinct and unique characters, is perfect for all ages and for people from all walks of life, because the author explores extremely different types of people and their distinct relationships with 1970's New York.
Stylistically, McCann utilizes a different narrator for each chapter. At first, I found this to be confusing and altogether unpleasant, but as the book progressed I found that it complemented and added to the themes of the story. Irish immigrants, New York City hookers, mourning upper-class mothers, judges and hackers seem to have nothing in common, yet McCann has the ability to link them together, create similarities and provide opportunities to understand the nuances of life in NYC. We understand how each individual and each class come together to contribute to society. The link among all people in the story is Philippe Petit's 1974 tight rope walk across the twin towers. McCann proves that seemingly polar and opposite people have similarities. Shared experiences help bind people and bring them together. It was extremely interesting to see how this one event could be witnessed and experienced by such a unique group of people and from such varying perspectives. Petit's tremendous feat, walking from one twin tower to the other on a wire provides an opportunity for the characters to learn and reflect on themselves. Additionally, it provides hope and a feeling that anything can be accomplished, even in the bleak and seemingly hopeless lives of our protagonists.
I also really enjoyed McCann's ability to develop setting and introduce characters. No matter the type of place or the traits of a character, McCann vividly and aptly depicts the scene. Most notably, at least for me, is his introduction of the lowly tenement district of New York. For the characters that live in the projects, nothing is easy. McCann's depiction of the setting truly sets us up for the feeling of hopelessness and despair of the projects, ""On one side was a row of high-rise tenements behind a chain-link fence. Parts of the fence were topped with razor wire. On the other, the expressway: the light-streak of cars zipping above. Below, by the underpass, a long line of women. Cars and trucks were pulling into the shadows. The women struck poses."" (24) McCann's description is clear, concise, and easily understood. Even for someone who has never visited NYC, the scene can easily be visualized and understood. His juxtaposition of what is seen (the highway) and what is hidden (the prostitutes) is interesting and well-thought out.
A final trait of McCann's writing that stood out to me was his ability to play with and take on any voice necessary. The narrative voice could be an Irish `monk', a hooker or an ordinary woman, ""The days I recall finest were about as ordinary as they come--playing hopscotch on the slab of broken concrete, following my brothers through the cornfields, trailing my schoolbag through the dust. My older brothers and I read a lot of books back then--a bookmobile came around our street once every few months, staying fifteen minutes."" (285) This writing is just so beautiful--simple, yet descriptive. Voice is the device that McCann explores most frequently. He expertly changes his voice and tone as he changes character.
All in all, I give this book a resounding A+. Everything about the writing, plot and style made me fall in love with the story and its characters. I couldn't put it down.",0.9791666666666666,objective review

McCann uses the story of Phillipe Petit, the French acrobat who walked a wire strung between the twin towers in 1974, to illustrate man's resilience, even in the face of great obstacles.

He further illustrates it through the lives of ""normal folks"" going about their business hundreds of feet below the high wire, down on the varied streets of New York. Regardless of their backgrounds and socio-economic status, they all struggle with unique issues and yearn for connection with another human being. And as the novel unfolds, we learn that all of their lives are interconnected...not just by a shared witnessing of the high-wire walk, but through a series of events that unfold around it, none of which could have been predicted.

Let the Great World Spin is a story of love and loss, of ""life passing through difficulty in order to achieve any modicum of beauty,"" and the human ability to find meaning even in the greatest of tragedies.

"C. B Collins Jr. (Atlanta, GA United States)","January 31, 2011",4.0,"There are certainly a great number of reviewers who thought very highly of this book. There are also some reviewers who were bored to death. Whereas I didn't think this was a fantastic book, I also didn't think it was terrible. It gets 4 stars in my opinion, good but not great. The book is a bit too long, just a bit too overwritten, almost to the point of being tedious in some of the chapters.
There are many themes and relationships which tie the book together but the primary events are when Philippe Petit walked a tightrope between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 and when a tragic car wreck changes the lives of every character in the story. The high-wore event is seen by thousands of people and their reactions to the event as well as to each other make up much of the book. However, it is actually the car wreck and the relationships of all kinds that pull the book together emotionally. It seems to follow the philosophy of nine degrees of separation between everyone on earth.
The Roman Catholic Irish monk, Corrigan, is a primary character, which seems like a modern day St. Francis. Yet he falls in love with a Guatemalan widow and political refugee with children. His brother Ciaran is his voice of reality. Tillie and Jazzlyn are a mother and daughter prostitute team and it is Tillie's relentless verbal hostility to the world that was the most tedious aspect of the book. Claire and Solomon are a wealthy couple who have lost a son in Vietnam. Gloria, a black woman, has lost several sons but her acts of redemption bring the story to closure.
Colum McCann is a good storyteller and the interconnected chapters, each almost like a short story, filled in all the details and put all the puzzle pieces together in the end so that the book offers closure. Closure is good for some readers. For me, I like a bit more depth of character.",1.0,objective review

"Laurence R. Bachmann ""LRB"" (New York)","January 25, 2011",5.0,"Let The Great World Spin is a novel I have resisted reading. As a native New Yorker I was extremely hesitant to engage in even a tangential ""9/11 novel"". I didn't think anything could even remotely capture the actual experience, the loss and sorrow of that day's events. I couldn't have been more wrong. LTGWS is brilliant and evocative--a work that lingers in one's memory and emotions long after the final page.

Most wonderfully, the struggle and the sorrow is not focused upon the horror of the WTC destruction. It is Phillipe Petit's glorious tightrope walk, skip and hop from tower to tower, and the lives of a handful of people below that serve as metaphor of precarious existence. Others have, in wonderful detail pointed out what is marvelous about this book and I happily join in the chorus of praise. In addition though, I can add that having lived in NYC at the time McCann describes, the author (who couldn't possibly have been there) seems to recall it effortlessly, with pinpoint accuracy, brutal honesty and great heart.

All of the splendor and pretense, the grit and the degradation of a city that seemed to be teetering on the brink of a great collapse are described in powerful, steely prose. Those who have complained about McCann not following strict short story forms, or who upbraid him because he doesn't seem to like policemen, I am sorry to say can't see the forest for the trees. The various chapters are not short stories, and shouldn't be judges as such any more than one part of tryptich should be evaluated apart from the rest. As for the grouse about not liking cops, read the dedication of thanks. It's pretty clear the author is describing his characters feelings about police. Not his own.

As for those who say that the voices of some characters didn't ring true, I say, not so! Each of them--Claire and Jazzlyn, Tillie and Corr, Gloria and Sol--as different as can be--rang true and clear to me. I hope everyone will give this book a chance. I thought the New York described in Let The Great World Spin was gone for ever. Wrong again. It lives in McCann's chapters--beautiful, ugly and hopeful still.",0.9285714285714286,objective review

"Michelaneous by Michele (Sandy Point Resort, Northwoods Wisconsin)","January 7, 2011",5.0,"Let The Great World Spin was a book club selection, which was enjoyed by all who attended, and it prompted a lively, intelligent discussion. The story is based on the lives of eleven characters on the day in 1974 when French funambulist, Philippe Petit, danced across a wire (tightrope) secured between the new twin towers at the World Trade Center in New York. It is a well-written, literary masterpiece with highly believable, three-dimensional (complicated) characters.

The characters are extremely diverse, and include an Irish immigrant ""monk"" with a heart of gold, a Park Avenue wife of a judge/mother of a son who was killed in Vietnam, a Guatemalan nurse to a young artist trying to kick a cocaine habit and living a 1920s lifestyle, a heroin-addicted streetwalking prostitute and her daughter and two young children. There is also a chapter where seemingly unrelated characters in Palo Alto, CA--a group of pioneering computer hackers--find a way to contact payphones in Manhattan on the day of Petit's performance, and try to get a live blow-by-blow account of the event from eye-witnesses. It's a reminder to the reader of the state of technology at the time, and how different the world of 1974 was from today, when the event, no doubt, would have been broadcast on every television station and the Internet.

This prompted our group to discuss our own ""day-in-the-life"" experiences we had on Sept. 11, when we first heard of the attacks on the twin towers. Not surprisingly, everyone in the room watched the horrendous events unfold on television.

The high wire event loosely connects all the characters and it feels as though the lives are spinning and folding atop one another in unexpected ways. In spite of the darkness and at times, overwhelming grief associated with these character's lives, the reader is left satisfied and reminded how different (and important) each life and each character's personal story is.

I give this book my highest recommendation.

Michael Snyder,"January 5, 2011",5.0,"That high-wire act in August, 1974. One man, with a little help from his friends, an unusual man who didn't allow notions of impossibility to sully his dreams into nullity, that man walked, hopped skittered danced and jumped from one World Trade Center tower to the other.

They were new then, those towers. And no one could possible conceive what would happen 27 years later. But thinking back, looking at a high-wire act for the ages that also happens to frame the stories told in Colum McCann's ""Let the Great World Spin"", and you can't help but think what a perfect recipe for metaphor, for a new way to understand --and muddle through -- this world we live in.

That high-wire act is above all things, every single life lived.

It's not a new idea for a novel. In some way every novel, even the terrible ones, maybe even especially the terrible ones, try to and somehow always achieve if only slightly, a new description of the world -- a prescription of the author's beliefs about our world -- and sometimes a proscription against it.

Personally, and what review isn't personal, I can be moved, displaced from my own perception of the world and into someone else's, but only when the novel is truly good, well-written, lyrical, effortless. And this one is.

Just let it swallow you up, let go. And as the stories move from one carefully drawn protagonist to another, as this great world of characters slowly grows into a portrait of our America in the 1970s, our world before 9/11, let the nuances within them, the special moments McCann crafts into his novel surprise you, move you to twinges of sadness and joy, and carry you away into the beauty, the grace in every single moment we have together.",0.7916666666666667,objective review

This winner of the National Book Award is worthy of our attention, both on its own merits and as an indication of the kind of book selected to receive such an award.

Set in 1974 the book recounts the experiences of a dozen or so figures. This is a time of pain and struggle, with Watergate, Vietnam and other events and issues dominating the news. Into this world steps Philippe Petit, a French wirewalker who stretches a line between the nearly-completed twin towers of the World Trade Center and walks back and forth, a quarter of a mile above the ground, without a net, for approximately 45 minutes. This is harrowing for more than the obvious reasons. Since the towers could sway approximately three feet in a high wind there remained the possibility of Petit being whipped off of the wire. The wire was stretched at considerable force (3 tons or so), so that if part of the wrapped wire came loose it could snap off his head or one of his limbs. Hence, the act was one of physical skill, courage, foolhardiness and grand performance art.

Petit's historic act is noticed by the fictional characters in the book. It serves as a point of learning, hope, amusement and surprise. It also underlines the ways in which individuals live their circumscribed lives, blind to what is around them until something stark and amazing impinges on their experience.

The lives of McCann's characters (hookers, a liberation-theology street priest, mothers who have lost sons in Vietnam . . . ) are not unrelievedly bleak, but neither are they particularly uplifting or encouraging. We are offered slight glimmers of hope in a world that weighs heavily on its occupants. It is, in short, a very `Irish' and very `New York' book. It's Joyce without the learning, the dark humor and the raw energy.

It is a very well-written book, with deep awareness of the culture of 1974 and a cast of interesting characters, all of whom hold our attention, but none of whom are likely to enjoy literary immortality.

Some readers have found it slow. It is somewhat slow at the beginning. The reader must begin with the awareness that s/he will have to persevere. It picks up the pace in succeeding acts and ends on a nice note. Part of its narrative logic concerns its thematic point that our lives are ultimately intertwined.

Critics and commentators are always telling writers `how they would have done it' or `what they would have preferred'. I would have preferred a book about Petit himself, who is far and away the most interesting character in the book. I could imagine a historical novel by a writer such as the Glen David Gold of CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL giving an interesting take on Petit, whose challenges are here represented with dizzying effectiveness but for a very brief time.

While LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN is a fine book, I can't imagine wanting to read it twice, though I might like to read a book that focused on one of its characters in greater depth and at greater length. It is a somber, momentarily hopeful statement, asserting that `this is the way the world is'. And so it is, to some.",1.0,objective review

The tales center around the tightrope walker making his famous walk between the two World Trade Center towers. The stories are all individually interesting but their overlap and cleverly thought out touchpoints is what makes this book great. McCann allows you to see from the viewpoint of all the characters and identify with all of their lives.

Lois W. Stern,"December 10, 2010",5.0,"Colum McCann

If you are looking for a `feel good' read, this probably is not the best book choice for you. But if you are looking for a book of depth and perception, that can capture a mood and essence of each character perfectly, I highly recommend Let the Great World Spin. This is NYC of the seventies - a period of Vietnam War unrest, drugs and prostitution - with the World Trade Center Twin Towers looming as a backdrop. Where were you when Philippe Petit made his daring high wire crossing between those two towers?

Let the Great World Spin starts softly, establishing a mood from which all characters emerge. Lives begin to mesh and collide. Events encircle his characters, so fully fleshed that they creep into your psyche while you're not looking. McCann's chapters depict events - at times sordid or disturbing, at times fascinating or outright humorous - yet each in its own way gripping and compelling. McCann's characters come alive through his uncanny ability to literally step inside their heads, with artistry that extends far beyond that of a fine storyteller. This author literally becomes the soul of each character, enveloping and permeating each persona as he translates their underlying emotions and thoughts through conversation, action and interaction.

McCann's adeptness with language enables him to paint landscapes, portraits and events with an artist's eye. Pick up a copy Let the Great World Spin and get ready for a memorable read.

""Let the Great World Spin"" is another kind of ""whole story""--the tightrope walking incident is a backdrop (although the story is indeed covered well here--I loved reading about the preparation and attention to detail it took to pull it off.) and the fulcrum for many other stories, all connected (albeit very loosely) to that incident.

The writing is great. It's at times funny, poignant, sad, thought-provoking, tragic and uplifting. Some of the characters are so ""real"" that I felt as if they could be my neighbors, my friends. While the book does have some stories that I felt were ""loose threads"", even those are well-written and serve a purpose.

The theme of human connectedness is handled very well here. The characters in the story are not only connected by the tightrope incident, they are connected in a ""two-degrees of separation"" sort of way and it's very interesting to see how the author manages linking people with such seemingly separate and disconnected worlds. In a post-World Trade Center Towers world, this is maybe more relevant and powerful than it could have been in 1974.

Jona (NY United States),"October 28, 2010",1.0,"I purchased this at my own risk, so there was nobody to blame but myself. And the author, maybe. And the prize, definitely, for misrepresenting the book, on top of keeping the library copies from being accessible any earlier. I ended up buying the book when the waiting lists for the library copies grew even longer due to the prize this novel received. Consequently the level of my scrutiny was automatically heightened. I could have given 2 stars if I read this in the library copy. Yet, I would have returned it before reading it cover to cover. The only reason I finished this was because, after all, I bought it. Darn it, the money was wasted so was the time.

I struggled to finish this book and it was frustrating and boring to death. I examined why; the writing did not live up to the vision the author initially might have to write the novel. So only his hypothesis was worthy while it did not have any substantial support. The meat--text-- was not too good to substantiate and deliver the very idea the hypothesis held; aren't we all tightrope walkers? This was also the notion that I had when I saw Man on Wire--the documentary film on Petit the actual figure who performed the tightrope walk in 74 in between skyscrapers of WTC. So when I happened to hear exactly the same idea from the author in his radio interview once, before the award was given to the novel, I was doomed to read this novel.

This book was filled with sentimentality that made it overall too syrupy and all was for the author's vanity and complacency. All the different characters' different voices and perspectives fell flat and as opposed to giving the reader a panoramic view as the author seemingly aimed in this project. I just saw cataloging here rather than anything like juxtaposing effect. Plotting diversity just by it--letting the priest befriend with the lowest-lifes possible-- is artistically and philosophically shallow and lazy. The penchant for objectification of sexworkers from the housing project was seriously unknown had it not been for glorification of the 'unconventional' priest's unlikely therefore valuable charity. Unfortunately, the depiction of 'girls' only read more patronizing than anything the author wished it to be. I believe he should have tried to construct the novel without the superficial employment of 'the others.' Focusing just Petit the tightrope walker and certain people whom he could earnestly invest his interest and passion in could have made the novel any better than what it really was. The text seriously needed more drastic editorial decision to reduce into even half of what's in print. What the author needed was that kind of courage, not looking into the Bronx to seek out the ultimate 'others' to show his ego off. Also, transplanting 9/11 situation into Vietnam era was such an easy solution that it only panned out implausible. Too overwritten on top of being too sentimental and superficial, I wonder if this was what other reviewers called 'pretentious.' Or complacency, I would rather put it to. The choppy and fragmented sentences did not surmount the ambitious structure, either.

Overall, I enjoyed the author's interview more than reading the book, let alone paying for it. But, hey, we are all tightrope walkers, and that I agree with, after all.",0.9583333333333334,objective review
Sallie,"October 26, 2010",2.0,"I had high hopes for this book from the rave reviews, but what I got was a writer trying to prove how clever he was. The result was tedious and I have to say slightly insulting.
I got the parody of Whitman and his lists(I am an English teacher after all) but that understanding wasn't necessary for the novel. But the author wanted me to know just how darned clever he was so he put in 2 callouts to Whitman before rubbing my nose in the 2 pages of lists of ""death by...""
However I stopped reading when I got to the chapter about Petit, the tight-rope walker, who was walking on his practice wire in the snow. The simile ""It seemed to him that it was like stepping along the spine of a horse toward a cool lake"" stopped me in my tracks - what meaningless nonsense!

When I got to the second half and had the ah-ha moment of seeing all of those characters and their lives intersect, it was like putting together an impossible 5,000 piece puzzle - so incredibly rewarding and meaningful. It's like life itself, really. How it takes time, and sometimes sadness, and sometimes patience to create a deep relationship with someone, but then doing that gets you to a place of incredible beauty.

Colum McCann

If you are looking for a `feel good' read, this probably is not the best book choice for you. But if you are looking for a book of depth and perception, that can capture a mood and essence of each character perfectly, I highly recommend Let the Great World Spin. This is NYC of the seventies - a period of Vietnam War unrest, drugs and prostitution - with the World Trade Center Twin Towers looming as a backdrop. Where were you when Philippe Petit made his daring high wire crossing between those two towers?

Let the Great World Spin starts softly, establishing a mood from which all characters emerge. Lives begin to mesh and collide. Events encircle his characters, so fully fleshed that they creep into your psyche while you're not looking. McCann's chapters depict events - at times sordid or disturbing, at times fascinating or out right humorous - yet each in its own way gripping and compelling. McCann's characters come alive through his uncanny ability to literally step inside their heads, with artistry that extends far beyond that of a fine storyteller. This author literally becomes the soul of each character, enveloping and permeating each persona as he translates their underlying emotions, thoughts and deeds through conversation, action and interaction.

McCann's adeptness with language enables him to paint landscapes, portraits and events with equal artistry. Treat yourself to a copy of Let the Great World Spin and get ready for a memorable read.

"Fran Trachtenberg (Washington, DC USA)","October 14, 2010",5.0,"His stunt stunned the people below. They strained their eyes and craned their necks toward a slim opening of the universe and in the early daylight they saw a tiny speck, a bird-like creature move in the thin air. He walked, danced, stood still, then shuffled again from side to side, first with one foot placed in front of the other, then only on his heels, now on his toes, with one foot in the air, turning around and around, and around again, sitting down, and finally prancing along a pliable wire that stretched across the heavens from south to north, from north to south, strung between the towers of the World Trade Center.

It was on August 7, 1974, a hot day in New York City, the day before Richard Nixon resigned, when he realized he could no longer balance the high-wire act of politics; on that summer day Philippe Petit, the French acrobat supreme, the immigrant itinerant, traversed the towers on a tightrope. He made it look so simple. Those watching thought it was an illusion, done with mirrors, the man held in the air by a helicopter. But he was no Mary Martin or Mary Poppins; Petit was the real McCoy, the genuine article.

On that morning, as they came up the steps of the subway station, got off the bus, picked up their morning coffee and went about their daily routines, real time crowds of Manhattanites witnessed Petit's magic act. People watched from office windows and later generations saw raw footage from home movies, read and listened to news reports, watched PBS's American Experience program, and screened the academy award winner, ""Man on Wire.""

At first the act stunned and then, almost immediately, thrilled the public, for the audience was pleased to turn its attention away not only from Nixon but also from the grimness and solemnity of the on-going war in Vietnam: better to talk about Petit and dream about becoming a free spirit.

In 2009, Colum McCann's novel, ""Let the Great World Spin"" won the National Book Award. Its story is about a collection of New Yorkers who are held together in literature, and perhaps in life, by the thin wire that supported Petit's audacious feat. Why one of us joyfully ends up in an exhilarated mid-air collision with the fates of the wind, hovering between the buildings of the WTC, and another of us struggles to maintain a modicum of dignity while toiling in the darkness underneath the Major Deegan Expressway, is just one of McCann's searches.

His story weaves the tales of apparently random folks who, like most New Yorkers, are two-degrees of separation from each other, and whose lives rub shoulders and shake hands with the devil, with saviors, with friends and foes, with the law and with each other in manners that illustrates how a swift act of fate can - in a mere nanosecond - upset the equilibrium, turn life upside down, right it again, or not.

McCann's book is as spellbinding as Petit's space walk. So many of the novel's characters wish to be liberated - freed from their toil, depression, from indignity, restraint and from over zealousness. He doesn't advocate, he doesn't wallow; he spins a story with a light touch about heavy subjects.

So many of us are wound up tight, snuggled into the skin of convention, of happenstance, of years and years of acts of social behavior that place us right smack in the middle of the road to protocol and tradition. How to unwind?

When I was in college, I found the decorum of first dates dreary. I had little patience for the so often asked questions, ""What's your major; where did you grow up; and what's next - grad school or work? How humdrum. I crafted a brief reply to take me away from all that. ""I'm an Hungarian (not true) tightrope walker (not true), whose family once ran a circus (not true) and I practiced each day by carrying a broom handle (not true) across a clothes line that ran between my parents' bedroom window and the tree in my back-yard. The clothesline was real. But as I reached out in the afternoon to pull in the sun-dried laundry, I didn't have Petit's imagination to traverse the towers of the world, nor McCann's poetry to spin the world on its axis. I knew I wanted to leave what I perceived to be the confines of my youth. Brooklyn was the fourth largest city in the world but its restraints and constraints were binding in many directions.

I drove into Manhattan every Saturday morning during the construction of the World Trade Center and watched the skyline of lower Manhattan become transformed by two towers of glass and steel that rose out of the ground like giant beanstalks. When photographed, the towers often seemed to be planted on a slope, refracted by a visual parallax that tilted them inward, as if their top floors would kiss in heaven when they ultimately reached the vanishing point.

It was the history of photography that captured my attention in college. And a camera's picture that gave McCann a motif, a literary device.

This book was suggested by a number of people and reviewed glowingly here on Amazon and on other websites. It sat on my shelf for a long while but I finally read it and finished it recently.

McCann takes a real-life event--Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the twin towers (World Trade Center) in New York--and then weaves a number of different tales about people who saw the walk or crossed paths with the walker (or each other) in some way. The characters are in the book are from different age groups, races and economic levels, even different countries--a support group of mothers who who have lost sons in the war, a group of hookers and the Irish monk who lives among them and tries to save them from themselves, and the judge who hears the case of the tightrope walker (since he did the walk on the sly, without any permission from the city, it was considered public endangerment at the very least). Family relationships are often at the core of the stories--the Irish monk and his brother, mother and daughter hookers, mothers who lost sons in the war, and one of the mothers in the support group is the wife of the judge who heard the walker's case. Like Kate Atkinson's Case Histories, McCann takes seemingly unrelated people and knits their stories together, sometimes having them show up in the same place in the same time (such as the mother & daughter hookers who happened to be in the same courtroom when the walker's case was presented).

Unfortunately, I am not a person who sits down and reads for hours at a time and finishes a book in a few days. I read perhaps 15-30 minutes each night at bedtime, and always have at least 2 books going at the same time, so it takes me a good while to finish each book. Also unfortunately, this is the kind of book that suffers from a long read. I think I would have liked it much more if I had read the entire book in 3 or 4 days. As it was, it felt a little fractured to me...like I was reading a book of short stories instead of a single cohesive story with multiple characters.

That is the only reason I'm giving the book 4 stars vs. 5, because there is no doubt that the writing is good. The writing is, in fact, exquisite. This, too, slowed down my reading, because I'd hit a passage that just sang out to me and I'd have to stop and let it roll around in my brain a few times, like savoring a fine wine or an expensive piece of chocolate.

"Zinta Aistars ""Writer & Editor"" (Portage, MI United States)","August 30, 2010",5.0,"Now and then, and not so very often, a writer is more of a magician. Perhaps even a medium, channeling other voices, the medium between the reader and the world he creates before our very eyes--out of nothing, a great something. Such is Colum McCann. It wasn't long before I was reading this book with reverence, with realization that I was holding in my hands a work of art.

The opening of the novel is a view of the sky, a mile and some up into the sky, where a tiny dot sways gracefully on a thin wire, strung between those two well-known towers, now gone. Our eyes are drawn upward, as if we, too, stand there, on the New York City pavement, heads thrown back. This tightrope walker is a true event from 1974, and McCann has built his fictional world around him, below him, to catch him and that moment of impossible grace. From high in the air, the author brings our gaze down, down, to the very depths and darkest corners of this famous and infamous city.

We see pieces and shards of lives, seemingly disconnected, until by book's end we see--all things, all lives are connected, as if a by a thin wire. We step into the lives of an Irish priest, of a street corner peopled by hookers sharing heroin needles, of broken-hearted mothers with sons lost to war, of a Park Avenue judge with frustrated ambitions, and of colorful artists. These are not whole lives, nor whole images, but pieces, just the same way we glimpse the lives of those around us every day. As if we know them, yet we know no one, not really, not even ourselves. Yet their experiences are powerful in the way that our everyday lives are--living, dying, struggling with dilemmas, evaluating our values, getting by.

McCann's writing can be dense, but it is never out of tune. Never. Draw a finger along with each line, read it aloud, and you will never find one word out of place. He writes like life is lived, without pretension. He writes the way we think. Choppy sometimes, long and drawn out sometimes, disjointed sometimes, coming together again sometimes. His intuition of perfect rhythm is breathtaking. His ability to speak as others, as anyone else, is perhaps the most masterful I have seen in literature in many years, and perhaps even more, perhaps a lifetime of reading. I am dumbfounded by his ability to write cross-gender, a man who somehow is able to fit himself inside a woman, and not just any woman, but an African-American middle-aged grandmother who is a hooker, and the fit is... there's that word again... perfect. He has it. He has her voice. I forget him entirely when I read her, he is gone, she is all that is there, and she fills the room in our minds with her vivid and vibrant presence. He gets it, how she feels under her hundredth man of the day, and the next moment how she thinks of her daughter, her grandchild, and fights for her family. What author can possibly accomplish this? Colum McCann.

""The men were just bodies moving on me. Bits of color. They didn't matter none. Sometimes I just felt like a needle in a jukebox. I just fell on that groove and rode in awhile. Then I'd pick the dust off and drop again."" (page 206)

She is an astounding character, embodying the shining best of a woman and the darkest and deepest kind of shadow. There is no judgment made about her, no lecture given, only a person presented, real and gritty and so close to you that you can see the blood pulsing in her temple and smell the sweat on her skin. Real. You can't just walk by her.

Another scene that stunned me with its mastery was one of a car accident, a moment in time captured as if outside of time. The author knows how time spins out in such a scene, and how our minds slow and speed again, replay the moment from a thousand different angles, spinning and spinning in a dizzying circle until all the colors blur together.

""The van spun farther. It was almost front-on. On the passenger side, all I could see was a pair of bare feet propped up on the dashboard. Untangling in slow motion. The bottoms of her feet were so white at the edges and so dark in their hollows that they could only have belonged to a black woman. She untucked at the ankles. The spin was slow enough. I could just see the top of her frame. She was calm. As if ready to accept. Her hair was pulled back tight off her face and bright baubles of jewelry bounced at her neck. If I hadn't seen her again, moments later, after she was thrown through the windshield, I might have thought she was naked, given the angle I was looking from. Younger than me, a beauty. Her eyes traveled across mine ... She was gone just as quickly. The van went into a wider spin and our car kept going straight.... The road opened like a split peach. I recall hearing the first crunch behind us, another car hitting the van, then the clatter of a grille ..."" (page 116-117)

On and on it goes, that slow unweaving description, spinning us into its vortex, until the image of the spinning van and the woman flying through the windshield becomes a permanent burn on the brain.

McCann does it again when he describes how the trapeze artist practices for his masterpiece of a moment, walking the cable strung between the two towers. One would think the author once again peeled away his own skin, unzipped that of the high wire artist, and stepped inside. Not one detail is missed.

This is a novel that is nothing short of a ballet of words. Changing rhythms, changing lighting, never losing a step or missing a breath. McCann won the National Book Award for this book, but I would hold out for even higher awards. I am still trying to remember how to breathe as I come out of the spin, slowly, of his literary magic.

Colum McCann is the author of the novels Zoli, Dancer, This Side of Brightness, and Songdogs, as well as two critically acclaimed story collections. His fiction has been published in 30 languages. He lives in New York City with his wife and three children.

Wisconsin Reviewer,"August 30, 2010",2.0,"My book club's selection, ""Let the Great World Spin"", promised to live up to its reviews and awards. I found it a muddle of language with long paragraphs of description (one paragraph that took up half a page consisted entirely of phrases that began ""Death by...."") Some of the characters were appealing, others shallow in both their development and world view. They all seemed to be haunted by voices from the past--the Park Avenue matron whose grief over her only son's death was poignant but bogged down in detail--petunias, bagels, ashtrays, mezuzzahs, cigarettes). (This writer should take a page from Hemingway and McCarthy and go for the pithy but succinct simple sentence.)

The writer's idiosyncratic use of punctuation and sentence structure seemed, after a point, just laziness. The book didn't hold my attention for more than 10 minutes at a time. After ten minutes, I put it down, annoyed with the lack of continuity and inadequate character development.

I've never been enamored of the glamor and grittiness of New York City. I'm even less impressed now. McCann seems better at describing Dublin where we get a definite sense of place and culture.

"Tanvi Buch ""tanvibuch"" (Los Altos, CA, USA)","August 28, 2010",2.0,"Overall, this was a very tediously detailed book. The writing was choppy and abrupt. The audio version was far easier to listen to than it was to read this book, and I tried and put down the book many times. As a concept, bringing together multiple lives under the skies of New York, and tying them all together in time with an event that is now history for New York - the tightrope walker between the then-newly built World Trade Center - is unique.
The book is divided into parts that have different protagonists. McCann has a wonderful, creative imagination and has clearly researched the lives of the various characters he has written about, but the writing is tedious and sometimes overly detailed to the point of dull. The first part [about Corrigan] and the second [about the prostitutes] were lengthy and rambling. The third part about the drugged couple who get into an accident made me sit up and take notice because suddenly the characters' lives overlapped and they became more a cause-and-effect of one another, rather than the apparently disparate lives they were leading. Tilly's chapter was wonderful - the highlight in the book, probably more so because I listened to the audio version of this book and the narration was superb. A couple of chapters and characters seemed to go nowhere, particularly the one about the graffiti photographer, and the computer hackers in Palo Alto. I felt for Adelita - that was another chapter I enjoyed. I did not connect with most of the characters - perhaps Tilly, Gloria and Adelita the most, Corrigan somewhat.
SPOILERS AHEAD...
There were certainly bright moments in the book. I loved how the tightrope walker connects all the characters in time - Tilly's fate only comes into stark attention in Soderberg's courtroom, but he is more interested in the tightrope walker who has been just brought in. I loved how one character is brought to the foreground in Soderberg's mind, but it is the one we as the readers are less interested in, since we've come to know Tilly better. Also well done were the hints and suggestions of previous characters in the stories of later characters, without the author telling us who they are e.g. I thought the doorman in Claire's story, because he was Irish, was Ciaran [Corrigan's brother] since he had been contemplating different jobs in New York. Who it was was not revealed, but the memory jog was cleverly done, and I didn't mind not knowing. Elsewhere, the nameless lady who adopted Jazzlyn's girls reminded me of Gloria, without that revelation then. I also thought that the drugged artist who let his paintings wash in the rain was perhaps the subway tunnel graffiti guy, but that was not made clear, and it made the story of the graffiti guy all the more pointless. I appreciated the detailed description about the feeling of the tightrope walker - not so much as the onlookers observing him - but his own feelings, his sense of the wind, the moisture in his eyes, his own balancing act with his body. That was lovely writing.
It is a sad book overall, and the ending could have been less abrupt.",0.9385964912280701,objective review
trin carl,"August 22, 2014",5.0,"""Let the Great World Spin "" by Colum McCann, a combined-story novel. I enjoyed this novel, and the way McCann spins the stories of characters who have unlikely chances of meeting one another. One of the stories discusses two Irish brothers, Corrigan and Ciaran who are on two different wave lengths, but end up both leaving Ireland and eventually living together in the Bronx.

We are introduced to Corrigan, who as a child empathizes with the poor, and who will do absolutely anything he can for the poor. He tells his mother that their situation is not that bad in comparison to those who have absolutely nothing. He meets the poor under bridges as they warm their hands, Corrigan listens to their stories. When the father of the brothers walks out of their lives, Corrigan brings the poor people his father's clothing, and his brother Ciaran merely watches as he gazes onto random strangers walking on the beach with his father's suits on. McCann also tells the story of Philippe Petit, the French acrobat who is a tight-rope walker.Its my belief that McCann introduces such a factual story into the plot of the book so as to raise the drama of novel and cast a story that readers can automatically visualize:The Twin Towers. Petit decides to walk the lengths of the former TWIN TOWERS just to see if he can do it; adding to his collection of buildings he's walked across. His walking between the TOWERS brings the attention of the New Yorkers who look up at him, in astonishment and see only a tiny speck in the sky, wandering who could possibly have the gall to do such a thing, admiring him, and at the same time holding great fear for this man's life.",0.25,negative review

It's actually terrific as a series on inter-connected short stories, but the perception that I got when I had first heard of the book was that it was a novel, and that made the reality a little jarring.

Just to get this off my chest: Just because Colum McCann is Irish doesn't automatically mean he needs to be compared with James Joyce. If there was another writer that I thought the story invoked, personally, it seemed more like Virginia Woolf.

In any case, the absolute best part of the book, and indeed the reason I would recommend it, is McCann's beautiful lyrical style of writing. Since each separate story is told by a different character, and since each character has a slightly different perception of the same event, McCann does a wonderful job of making sure that each story has its own voice. Without wishing to strain a metaphor, this seems akin to walking a tightrope; it looks easy, but go ahead and try it yourself.

I wholeheartedly thought his decision to leave Philippe Petit mostly an enigma (I don't even think he's ever even named) was correct. Petit's wire-walk is the MacGuffin around which the stories pivot. It's not the story itself. I'm not positive, but I wonder if the book as a whole wouldn't have been stronger if the story about Petit's preparation for the walk (which I gather is wholly an invention of the author) had been omitted. That story did a reasonable enough job of keeping Petit mysterious, but I do think it was perhaps unnecessary.

Now for the criticism:

While each individual story is well-written and pitch-perfect in its style, the transitions between them can be jarring. A lot of other reviews have specifically mentioned the story about the computer hackers as being out-of-place. For me, it was the highlight of the book, and the staccato, machine-gun delivery was one of the best pairing of character and style of the books. Having said that, it is so dissimilar all of the other stories, I can see why it jumps out at people, especially since it's located toward the middle of the book.

Finally, the last story, with its jump to present day, with the required references to Iraq, Afghanistan, 9/11, and Katrina was completely unnecessary. I think I understand the intent, to tie everything together in one final vignette, but it just didn't work.",0.32222222222222224,negative review

Paul Cuneo (United States),"July 23, 2010",4.0,"A novel of interlocking stories set in New York of the 1970s. Interweaving characters in this way (prostitutes, priests, a judge's wife, computer hackers) runs the risk of becoming ridiculous - it always feels false when someone attempts to create meaning out of piles of coincidences - but McCann largely succeeds. Most of the discrete sections feel complete, and the persistent reappearance of certain characters does not feel forced. This is a book that expands. It conveys the enormity of the world, while treasuring the human process of carving it into stories.

Some sections are stronger than others. In part this may be because McCann's writing style is surprisingly static from narrator to narrator, despite some curious cosmetic changes (sometimes speech is marked with quotation marks; sometimes not). He loves clipped, fragmentary, elusive sentences. He inhabits his characters without attempting to become them. Some come out more clearly than others. At worst, he can seem unconvincing and flat.

But the novel's momentum will carry the reader by its rough spots. Finishing it over the course of a day left me genuinely uplifted and touched. It is a sincere book that tries to speak to the world as it is. For McCann the possibility of beauty is an everyday thing, something to be earned through living, and the past is a curse that can recede.

This book is really a collection of short stories. And I love collections of short stories almost always. This is no exception.

C. P. Jackson (Fairfax),"June 17, 2010",4.0,"McCann doesn't tell the same story twice. Neither does he use a recognizable formula. What is recognizable to familiar readers is the brilliant prose he uses to pull you in. Like his earlier books, he really knows how to set the scene. Here in near-bankrupt 1970s NYC, he writes on-point descriptions of everyone and everything, from the uniformed Park Avenue doorman to the decaying South Bronx with stops in the Village. He brings together characters in spite of - really because of - their differing misfortunes and sea-separated cultures. Thus, the opening chapters, narrated by one of the Brothers Corrigan, promises to be McCann's best work. Perhaps because I read this book as chapters rather than related short stories, for me, it didn't fulfill the promise. There are too many people, too many forced connections. By the end, it wound down and fell over.

The best developed parts are told by one of the Corrigans. Neither brother's first name is revealed until much later. The narrator calls the other by their last name. His reason is explained so simply, and defines the brother so well, that I re-read the line. Throughout the book, the dialogue is crisp and natural. With some exceptions, McCann doesn't encase the dialogue in quotation marks. His dashes, which separate the speakers, are especially effective in a multi-party conversation. Usually when a storyline is left unfinished, a reasonable conclusion is picked up later by another character. But, too often this doesn't happen: like with the computer hackers and the photographer, people drop out of sight never to be heard from again. Were these characters inserted just to show a broader expanse of the New York populace? I was especially disappointed in how stereotypes were worked. This writer can script familiar stereotypes (read `Zoli') and smash them so hard that the reader is forced to examine his own prejudgement of the stranger. He failed to do that here, especially with Gloria, the opera-lover with a Syracuse U degree. She came off as a caricature, stuck in the projects and an out-sized, flowered dress.

So, why the four stars? Every scene in which the Corrigans and Tillie appear pulsates with realism even though I don't know anyone like them. And, walking, dancing a tightrope between the Towers is an inventive allegorical element.",0.9679487179487178,objective review
Bibliophile  the Sea (US),"June 9, 2010",5.0,"I was a little hesitant to read this book, but peer pressure won over, and I am so happy I caved. This is one ""audio book"" that is just terrific. It is read by a full cast : Richard Poe, Gerard Doyle, Carol Monda, Johanna Parker, Ramon de OCampo, Chris Sorenson and Patricia Floyd. The story begins on a summer morning in 1974, in New York City as a man balances on high above on a tight rope between the Twin Towers in NYC. As people below stare up in disbelief, the lives of other every day people continue on as usual.

The novel is almost like a series of short stories, but before long their stories begin to connect: a Jesuit priest, a judge, a prostitute, a wealthy, but grieving Park Avenue woman are a few of the characters that appealed to me. My favorite story/character was Tillie, a prostitute, down on her luck, and now in jail reflecting on her life and that of her grandchildren. (You MUST listen to the audio version to fully appreciate all that Tillie has experienced).

Without going into the details about all of the stories, I'd just like to say that this was such a beautiful novel. It was about human beings -- their every day struggles, and the circumstances and vulnerabilities that make all of us who we are. Each unique character was captured perfectly, as the author skillfully weaves together the dysfunctional lives of some of the most memorable people I've met, through a book, in a long time. For me, truly a sign of an exceptional literary work. McCann shows NYC at its finest and at its worst: all classes, all races -- all truly memorable. Toward the end of the book, although 9/11 is not mentioned, the story jumps to 2005 with a story about the war in Iraq and references to airport security etc,. It was here that I was reminded of just how precious our days are, and just how connected each of us are no matter where we reside.

May (New York City),"June 7, 2010",4.0,"This is a very good book. Don't get me wrong. It was a very enjoyable reading experience and I would recommend this book to anyone. That being said, I started reading this book with sky high expectations and I have to say at the end I was kind of disappointed. The book did not succeed in blowing me away, and I think I know why.

McCann is a superb writer and he really has a way with words. His imagery, diction, and the way he can so seamlessly slip into the heads of characters from different walks of life is pretty amazing. In this novel, he writes several spectacular short narratives and then falls short on cohesiveness when attempting to tie all the threads together at the end.

We've got some great characters: the heart-wrenching Corrigan, the warm, generous Gloria, or the painfully stiff and slightly pathetic Claire, who all arouse sympathy and are flushed out with mastery in their introductions to the story. They really come alive under Mccann's pen, but as the narrative moves forward their stories are swallowed by the confusion of characters McCann has constructed in his ambition. There are too many characters, and McCann did not do all of them justice. I read five pages of superb , profound prose about a graffiti tag photographer, and then he is never mentioned again save under a photograph-- clever, but unsatisfying. Three tech kids working in California appear in one chapter and then disappear forever. What's confusing is McCann picks and chooses the characters he wants to give endings to like he's playing favorites, and never gives a reason as to why some characters get a huge hunk more exposure than others.

Needless to say, this made the reading experience slightly disjointed, and I was disappointed that only some characters' stories were revisited. Note to author: If you're only interested in these characters, stick to them, or give everyone equal facetime at least. Of the stories that were flushed out, however, McCann does a great job at building intrigue, but he sometimes veers off into the realm of cliche and convenience. Many of the coincidences and connections between the characters in the novel seem improbable, and McCann's wish to make everything in the plot do double duty ends up making parts of the narrative seem forced and constrained.

Another thing that bothered me about this book was it's failure to draw up strong emotion. This may be cliche, but I usually know I've read a good novel when I've laughed, cried, and forgotten to eat too. I think i did chuckle while reading ""Let The Great World Spin,"" but for such an ambitious, atmospheric title, the novel fell short on emotional delivery. There could have been so many emotional high points, with the turmoil and insanity of these character's lives, but I never felt tears well up in my eyes in empathy for any of these characters, and I found that extremely odd. This may have had to do with the too-many-characters-too-little-time-for-everybody problem that I mentioned earlier, but usually by the end of a great novel my breath is caught in my throat and goosebumps are running down my spine. I was disappointed that with ""Let The Great World Spin,"" neither were the case.

Additionally, sometimes wording is awkward and plot development uncomfortable, with the last paragraph being extremely awkward in this regard as McCann describes an unlikely encounter between a certain important young woman and an Italian man. The chapter made me feel sleazy and a bit skeptical, especially with McCann's awkward brushing over of the sex scene as if he's not quite sure what to do with himself. Many other instances like that in the novel had an unpleasant jarring effect on the reading experience.

Of course, I'm being nitpicky here. I gave the book four stars and it deserves all four; McCann has written a very good novel that is much better than a lot of the other stuff out there. It deserves all the recognition it has gotten, and I only focus on the negatives in these reviews to put some of the over-praising odes into proportion. In my opinion, this novel was good, but not great. If you want an extraordinary book on 9/11, one that will blow you away and make you fall in love head over heels, read Foer's ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.""

"JoeV ""Reader"" (Arlington Hts, IL)","June 6, 2010",2.0,"Let The Great World Spin was published last year to rave reviews. Descriptions included magical, sweeping, brilliant, poignant and the perfect New York novel. I am definitely out of step when it comes to current fiction because I missed the magic here - finding this book more style than substance.

The book is a set of vignettes chronicling a loosely connected set of Manhattanites in August of 1974. In the background are the Vietnam War, Nixon's resignation and Phillipe Petit- a man who stretched a cable between the World Trade Twin Towers - 103 stories up in the air - and went for a stroll - successfully.

Our cast includes two Irish brothers; one a catholic priest, who lives among and befriends a pack of heroin addicted prostitutes; a grieving mother who lost her son in the Vietnam War; and a young married couple trying to break into the NY art world in between cocaine binges. Not the most original or creative set of characters, but with a good story to guide them great novels are made. Unfortunately, and this is the biggest fault I had with Let The Great World Spin, the author doesn't tell us their stories - he explains them. Therefore the characters never became real to me - just their dialogue seemed surreal - and the narrative simply overwhelmed any and all of the underlying stories.

Think of watching a movie sitting next to someone who has seen it before and feels the need to keep whispering in your ear - detailing plot twists and characters' actions.

Reader from Singapore,"June 5, 2010",5.0,"Colum McCann's 2009 National Book Award winner ""Let The Great World Spin"" has restored my faith in the ability of book award committees to pick a truly deserving winner with outstanding literary merit that's also accessible to the reading public. Far too often in recent years, we have had declared winners which have left many readers baffled at the judges' choice.

This ensemble novel of life in New York City in the mid-70s is a gorgeous piece of art and a thing of beauty because of its breathtaking sweep and bold ambition in portraying all of humanity's diversity especially its seamiest side at their most basic level and demonstrating how our response to situations we find ourselves in makes us all unlikely but no less real heroes in survival.

Just as the French funambulist Philippe Petit had left New Yorkers gaping in amazement at his mind blowing feat of traversing the World Trade Centre towers across thin air on a thin piece of wire, why shouldn't we be similarly awed by the more mundane but equally heroic struggles of a motley crew comprising an improbably idealistic liberation theologist, drug addicts and prostitutes on main street below? For haven't each of them been visited by miracles of another sort ? Like the priest in plainclothes finding himself playing Jesus to the down and out and also the love of a woman without guilt or compromise, or a pair of mother and daughter prostitutes who hold their heads up high playing parent figures to their children/grandchildren, or one among a group of commiserating mothers who lost her son in Vietnam but not the capacity to give and receive love?

Not all the stories happening simultaneously are given the full treatment. Some are merely hinted at or partially revealed. Yet each of them is firmly etched in our hearts and minds. That's how strong McCann's characterization is - the computer hackers feeding back on the Frenchman's hair raising feat, the unnamed secret night time photographer of subway graffitis, etc - they are walk on parts but utterly memorable and integral to the whole. I would have liked a little more elaboration of the judge's motivations though. These disparate strands interweave and finally resolve in a denouement that's both heartbreaking and life affirming.

"Gregory Zimmerman (Chicago, IL)","May 25, 2010",5.0,"Better described as a literary work of art than a novel, Let The Great World Spin, is brilliant and profound -- and well-deserving of its National Book Award. As life is episodic, so are the interconnected stories of a diverse cast of characters that populate this novel. An Irish Catholic monk. An African-American hooker, and her heroin-addicted daughter. A wealthy socialite named Claire grieving the loss of her son in Vietnam. A Jewish judge. Computer geeks. A guy who photographs graffiti. The novel revolves around the connections -- often in unexpected ways -- of these characters with the common thread of Philippe Petit's daring tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in August, 1974.

Part of the wonder of the novel is the verisimilitude with which McCann renders these characters. Endowed by their creator with beautiful, elegant, but clearly delineated voices, these New Yorkers practically spring off the page. They are so real, themselves so human. And through them, McCann offers a simple road map for being human: Connect. Love. Hope.

But the novel isn't just about the interconnectedness of people; it's about connecting with a moment, a memory, an image. As the broke-down hooker Tillie wastes away in jail, she remembers a week spent at an expensive hotel with a trick who only wanted to talk with her, respected her, practically loved her. She relies on that memory to help her navigate the vicious downward spiral of her life. Gloria, a poor black woman, who befriends the grieving mother Claire based on their shared experience of losing children to the Vietnam War, explains this idea as clearly as the English language could render it: ""I guess you live inside a moment for years, move with it and feel it grow, and it sends out roots until it touches everything in sight.""

This novel is also a portrait of New York City. Spanning races and classes, it's a tribute to the city's diversity, richness and history. As McCann tells us through one of his characters, ""The city lived in a sort of everyday present....New York kept going forward precisely because it didn't give a good goddamn about what it had left behind."" And then later, ""(The tightrope walker) had made himself a statue, but a perfect New York one, a temporary one, up in the air, high above the city. A statue that had no regard for the past."" For that reason, Petit's walk was a ""stroke of genius.""

And though 9/11 is never mentioned explicitly, it's clearly the undercurrent for and possibly the impetus of this novel. As people connected based on the novelty and shared experience of Petit's walk, so also did they connect on the shared and horrific experience of the terrorist attacks on the most horrific day in American history. McCann, seemingly randomly at the time, includes a photo of ""a man high in the air while a plane disappears, it seems, into the edge of the building."" The photo's weird trick of perspective didn't mean anything particularly interesting until 27 years after it was taken. Now, looking at it, and contemplating its prescience, you can't help but shudder.

This is a novel that I cannot leave; it really affected me. As I've written this, I've gone back and reread several of McCann's elegant passages. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but for McCann, it only takes 95 or so. He conveys images, emotions, memories in words and phrases that are just so precise. For example: ""She had the bluest eyes, they looked like small drops of September sky."" How many times have you read novelists who totally flub an eye-description analogy? Not McCann -- it's perfect, and that's just one of hundreds of examples throughout the novel. I can't recommend it more highly. Please read it. Please.",0.8859649122807018,objective review
"D. Sorel ""book lovah"" (Massachusetts USA)","May 20, 2010",4.0,"At first glance (or read) this book seems to be a collection of short stories that take place in New York City around the time that a tightrope walker walked across a rope between the Twin Towers as they were being built in the 1970s. However, the reader soon realizes that these stories are intertwined and are beautifully woven together into one overlying story told in a cacophony of voices.

McCann has chosen New York City as the setting for this novel and the diverse peoples of the city are his characters. His first character is Corrie who was originally from Ireland but moved to America and has taken up residence in the projects of the Bronx where he helps the elderly and prostitutes alike. The next series of stories involve a group of women who have lost son's in the Vietnam War. Lastly, are a couple of stories involving a young married couple who have chosen to abandon their reckless drug-riddled life and start anew in the countryside. Interspersed between these stories are vignettes about the tightrope walker and his great mission to cross between the Twin Towers. When tragedy strikes, these independent series of stories come together into one powerful overriding tale.

This is by far one of my favorite books of 2009. Each story is written beautifully and can easily stand on its own. Yet the connection between all of the stories brings together so many different voices and narrators that the overall story is overwhelmingly powerful. McCann's descriptions of poverty, grief, love, and compassion can not go with praise. Though he is originally from Ireland, he is able to tell of life in New York City better than most actual residents would be able.",0.2847222222222222,negative review
lisadee,"May 20, 2010",4.0,"let the great world spin, by colum mccann, is an intricate, elegant, novel with inter-locking/over-lapping storylines (in some ways, it reminded me of alice mattison's novel in short stories called women yelling, men giving money : intersecting stories, and, to a lesser extent olive kitteridge, by elizabeth strout). the novel takes place in new york city in august 1974, on the day funambulist philippe petit walked across a tightrope between the world trade center towers. although petit's walk is in some sense central to the novel, his character is not. the book follows several characters (about a dozen), most of whom have some connection to each other, whether they are aware of it or not.

the story begins in ireland, told by the brother, ciaran, of a man called by his last name, corrigan. very early on ciaran says this of his brother: `corrigan sat on the wall, banging his heels and looking over the flat strand to the water. i should have known even then that thse sea was written in him, that there would be some sort of leaving.' (pg 12). young corrigan spends his time with `the drunks.' ciaran says, `the down-and-outs needed him, or at least wanted him--he was, to them,a mad, impossible angel.' (pg 17). corrigan's calling takes him to the bronx, where he becomes a bit of `a mad, impossible angel' to the prostitutes who walk the streets outside his apartment. he lets them use his bathroom, buys them coffee. when they go to jail, he tries to help get them out. he also drives a van for a nursing home, taking some of the residents on day trips. there is a young nurse who works at the home, adelita, with whom he has a complicated relationship. on ciaran's first meeting with her, he describes the scene this way: `something fierce shot in the air between them. he loosened around her, his body more pliable. he put his hand on the small of her back...' (pg 44)

we meet mothers: adelita has two children; tillie, a prostitute and her daughter, jazzlyn, who is also a prostitute. jazzlyn has two very young daughters of her own. claire, a wealthy woman living on park avenue, lost her son, joshua--a brilliant computer whiz--to a bomb in vietnam cafe; and gloria, a neighbor of corrigan, whose three sons were also killed in vietnam.

there are also fathers: solomon and pino. solomon, a judge, is joshua's father. he wonders `why he bought the toy soldiers all those years ago. he fretted over the fact that he'd made joshua learn ""the star-spangled banner"" on the piano. he wondered, if, when he taught the boy to play chess, he had somehow instilled a battle mentality? ... there must have been somewhere that he'd hard-wired the boy.' (pg 263). pino, whom we meet years after the events of 1974 (post-katrina, even) is in new york city to buy his son a chess set...

there are other characters, an artist who is involved in a terrible car accident, a young, aspiring photographer, and a young hacker from California who helps route phone calls all over to make free phone calls and ends up getting to speak to someone on her way to work the morning of the walk across the tightrope. he gets the woman to describe the scene for him.

one of the things i found so interesting was the way the connections were made--when a revelation is made, it happens smoothly (organically to the story). a few times i could see things coming, but not always, and in those cases i probably should have, but oh well.

it is impossible, or was impossible for me, to read this without thinking about 9/11 and the towers that are no longer there. so much has changed in the world since the time period of this novel--as well as since the towers fell. far-off wars still rage on, prostitutes still walk the streets, people still take their eyes off the road at the wrong moment--and also, some unlucky children still get a break, the garbage gets collected, many things, for many people are better.

this was an interesting, well-written novel. i highly recommend it.

"Ti ""Book Chatter"" (California)","May 19, 2010",5.0,"Let the Great World Spin is a collection of stories. Did you know that? I did not. However, the stories are told from several different points of view, and although each character has a very distinct voice, the stories eventually collide with one another leaving the reader standing there, wondering who or what comes next.

Something terrible happens, and as the chain of events unfold, we view the same event from different perspectives. Itfs as if the world is spinning in slow motion, and we are forced to look at the bits and pieces that are not normally noticed when time moves at a more normal pace.

Many of these characters are flawed. They are striving for something, and often find themselves on the outside looking in. As they observe the world around them, life as we know it, continues on. As I read this book, I was mesmerized by the authorfs ability to take me in and out of a characterfs head. One story is told from a prostitutefs point of view, and as I was reading her story, I felt what she was feeling, the frustration, the loss, the helplessness. It was a lonely place to be.

I know I havenft said much about the plot, but as you can imagine, when something terrible happens, there is a downward spiral that takes place. As things come crashing to a halt, there is no place to go but up. This book is like that. We take the plunge into despair, visit with these characters awhile, and then wefre given a small glimpse of what lies ahead. To me, the the plot didnft really matter. I was so absorbed the the internal conflict within each character that plot was secondary to me.

I love this book. I appreciate this book. I am in awe of this book.

It has a quiet, understated quality to it that I wasnft expecting. The characters are complex and conflicted and even though some of them may not be the type of people Ifd be friendly with, I could relate to many of them. This is the type of book that you can re-read, and see (and feel) something different each time you pick it up.

However, the characters are actually tied together by a sort of extended family tree portrait that paints a picture of the origins of the life of a particular young woman.

Was the writing uneven and lacking focus at times? Yes. However, I don't think that that distracts from the book at all. Life is like that. This book is about life. If it were consistent, driving, thrilling from page to page, then it wouldn't be as compelling.

I tend to rate books by whether or not I though my time was well spent, and worth the few dollars I spent to read it. In this case, I feel that I was more than amply rewarded by the experience. There were slow points, but it was never a struggle. When the writing was good, it was brilliant. When I was done, I was glad to have read it.

I enjoyed the interconnectedness of these disparate characters on a summer day circa 1974 in NYC. Actually, on the very day the Frenchman, Phillip Petit tight-roped between the twin towers. So it's a nice idea. There's much to like in the style of the writing--it is bursting with life and bon mots. But to me, great writing does not necessarily mean the story is there. That's -to me--the downside of this work. It's worth a read, though, in the sense that the concept is strong and there are sections and characters that are well-portrayed. It's the overall narrative I had a problem with.

There are other novels out there that are so effective because they contain a driving narrative that resonates with readers. The writing itself may not be exactly flourishing and florid as it is here, but the overall story is. Right to the very end.

"B. Hill (Chicago, IL USA)","May 4, 2010",4.0,"I wrote the following email to a friend regarding this book, and realized that it could also serve as a fairly detailed all-purpose review on a site like Amazon. So here it goes ...

I've been meaning to send you a quick message to let you know what I thought of Let the Great World Spin, which I finished a few weeks ago. It's definitely worth a read, but with a number of caveats.

First, I felt like it took quite a while (at least 100 pages) to really get into the book, and even then, the structure of the book (which consists of various interconnecting narratives) results in a rather uneven read. For example, a full chapter in ""Book Two"" (albeit only eight short pages in length) is devoted to a character that contributes essentially nothing to the novel; those eight pages are almost like a stand-alone short story (and not a great one at that) that the author felt compelled to include in the novel merely to show off his literary skills (see second criticism below). There are a number of additional characters and/or passages in the book that feel similarly tacked on.

Second, while McCann's prose in some instances blew me away with its lyricism / insight / beauty (like: WOW! I would reread passages and just be stunned), at other times, I felt that the writing was just plain pretentious -- like a Harvard English major straining to write a novel that would be taken seriously as literature. I recognize that the line between these two things is not necessarily that well defined (and certainly highly subjective), but at various points in the novel, *whole pages* worth of prose would just get beneath my skin, and I can not recall having a similar reaction to any other novel I have read in the past 10 or so years.

Third, while the novel's ""payoff"" (or takeaway or theme or message or whatever) is pretty intellectually compelling (it's really a reflection on 9/11, which the author manages to achieve without ever mentioning 9/11, even after the novel transitions to the present in the final ""Book""), at the same time, I also felt like the story was simply Crash taking place in NYC in the 1970s, told in a more highbrow literary vein (see my second point) with a *slightly* shifted (and slightly more subtle) thematic focus. And while I was, I admit, a fan of the movie Crash, I also thought it was ludicrously overrated and that most criticisms of it were well deserved; I ultimately feel the same way about Let the Great World Spin.",0.9666666666666667,objective review

And I guess that is where my discomfort lies - he and I don't have chemistry because of his writing style. I wanted so much to love this book but found it had pacing and character problems. Using Petit's cable walk is both genius and kind of trite ('oh our precarious world'). This is at best a short story as it did not engage me over its length as a novel.,0.9,objective review

Every now & again there's a sentence that would have me setting the book down to ponder the original thought. But there were too many characters, none of whom was really the focus. It's supposed to be understood that the focus is the tightrope walker, but his presence is felt rather than experienced. That being said, I found the book to be lacking in depth, what with each chapter taking a turn with a new face. It's an interesting device that would've worked better if the characters could've been fleshed out more. What with tackling so many, there's a redundancy, in terms of these people questioning themselves, their lives, their regrets. That constant questioning after awhile became tedious.

"Karissa Eckert ""Devourer of all books fantasy"" (Minneapolis, MN)","April 28, 2010",4.0,"I listened to this book on audio book; the audio book was really well done with each story being read by a different person who really fit the character. I picked this book up because I had heard such wonderful things about it. It was a very interesting book and overall I enjoyed it.

The book is basically broken down into a series of short stories about different people living in New York City in the 70's. In between stories there are interludes about a tight rope walker who walks between the world trade center towers. In the end all of the stories and characters are tied together in some way.

The book starts out a bit slow; depicting the early life of a pair of Irish brothers and telling about how they ended up in New York City. One of the brothers is looking for the meaning of God in the derelicts of New York. Then there is a story told from the point of a old woman who lost her son in Vietnam. The next story is told by one of the hookers the Irish brother tries to help. Then a story about a young hacker who hacks into phones near the World Trade Center during the tightrope walk. Next a story from the mother of the hooker who the Irish brother helped. Then a story from a judge's point of view, he is the husband of the woman who lost his son in Vietnam. This is just an example of the first few stories...you get the point. There are nine stories in total, they are interrupted by interludes about the tight rope walker.

McCann does a great job creating believable characters that, while not very likable at times, are easy to sympathize with. All of the characters are very human. There is some plot as the stories of all the individuals interconnect and culminate in an interesting ending. I wouldn't say the book is really plot driven though, it is more about taking glimpses into the lives of ordinary people and what makes them make the decisions they make. McCann goes into deep descriptions so that you can easily visualize the settings and there is a lot of internal dialogue from the characters telling the story. This is definitely not an action driven book but more of a slow paced mystery of sorts and a story of the social picture in New York at the current time frame.

The title of the book basically tells you the point of the story: no matter what happens history repeats itself and people's lives go on.

One of my biggest gripes about the book is that it moves at a very deliberate pace. People who are into action or plot driven stories should skip this one. If you are interesting in society and history, or about the ordinary man's story than you will enjoy this book. The other thing that bothered me was how unresolved the ending was. I was expecting something awesome and the book just kind of ends at the middle of a scene...I suppose this does depict life but I don't really like my stories to end this way.

Overall I liked the book. It was well done and gave an interesting look into the New York City of the 1970's. The characters were well done and believable; listening to this on audio book with the different speakers was awesome. The pace of the book is pretty slow and the ending very open, which were the only negatives to it. This book is for people interested in the human condition and history. Action fans or mystery fans shouldn't expect much of either here.",0.9632352941176471,objective review
"Elisabeth S. Wang ""Babbette from Babbette's B... (Atlanta, GA)","April 28, 2010",2.0,"Colum McCann's Let the Great World Spin may just be the best book I've read that I didn't like. Winner of the National Book Award for fiction last year, McCann's novel reads more like a collection of short stories about various residents of New York City whose lives are connected by a single event in 1974 - the day a tight-rope walker decided to walk between the World Trade Center towers.

First, what I did like. McCann's writing is beautiful - poetic at times. Two examples:

""Family is like water - it has a memory of what it once filled, always trying to get back to the original stream."" (pg. 57)

""I gave them all of the truth and none of the honesty."" (pg. 303)

And the writing is dense - it has weight. But what was lacking for me was an emotional connection to the characters - at least most of them. Keeping to the things I liked, I loved the character of Claire. Claire lives in a Park Avenue apartment (she refuses to call it a penthouse) and is married to an esteemed and Jewish judge. They lost their only son in Vietnam, and in a desperate attempt to connect with women who have experienced her level of loss, answers an ad in the paper. She invites her new club - which includes a black woman who happens to be the one Claire is drawn to the most - to her home and frets over ensuring that each one is made welcome and treated well.

The energy that comes from her story is powerful. Her desperation to mourn her son and have him known, her anxious need to be accepted by these women, it is poignant and bittersweet. The tight-rope walker intersects Claire's story on the morning of the gathering at her house. One of the ladies saw the walk on her way in, and the mothers chide the idea that a son would be so reckless with his life. An insightful story and interesting connection to the common thread.

If only the other stories had been the same for me. Another primary character is Corrigan, an Irish celibate living in poverty in keeping with a religious order. He keeps a minimal apartment with no locks so that the local prostitutes can use it to have a clean place to use the bathroom and freshen up. As his intentions are misunderstood by the girls' johns, he is frequently beaten up.

From Corrigan's story, we meet Tillie and Jazzlyn - mother/daughter prostitutes - Corrigan's brother, the girl Corrigan falls in love with and a couple of hippie artists enjoying a drug binge. But I just didn't care about these folks - for whatever reason, the emotion wasn't there.

I think the idea for McCann's book is really good, and some would obviously say well executed. But for me, it didn't hit the mark. I read this one for my book club at work, and had it not been for that, this may have been one I decided to put down.",0.4166666666666667,negative review

I thought his words met and touched in a very profound way, penetrating deeply, going far beneath the external, the superficial, or the obvious, defining a little world within a great world.

About the novel, McCann said, ""I wanted it to be a Whitmanesque song of the city, with everything in there, high and low, rich and poor, black, white, and Hispanic. Hungry, exhausted, filthy, vivacious, everything this lovely city is. I wanted to catch some of that music and slap it down on the page so that even those who have never been to New York can be temporarily transported there."" I thought he succeeded beautifully -- it's all in there (even young and old). I was transported back to New York, to that time and place. I was living it along with the characters.

He also said, ""The question, as a writer, was how to find meaning at all when there was, in plain sight, a world charged with meaning. If everything meant something--even a child's simple question about burning--then how was it possible to create an alternative meaning, or more exactly a novel?"" I felt like I knew these characters. I felt so much empathy for them.

Beautiful, patient shots of cranes and juggernauts and swinging headache balls caught on sixteen-millimeter. It anticipated much of the art that came behind it--light filtering in through smashed warehouse walls, window frames lying over puddles, new architectural spaces created by fracture.""

However, I will tell you how I felt about the book as I read through it - I found the first two stories very easy to read and enjoy. But then as I continued reading others with new characters it became difficult to really get into all of them. I almost felt like there were just a few too many - you reach a certain point where you want to start seeing them all come together and for me that point came a little too late in the book. Once that began to happen, I started to really enjoy the book again. And after I finished it, I really liked the whole sum of the parts.

We read this for my book club and I can tell you that I think other members felt the same way - when we met many had stopped reading, or hadn't finished due to their frustration. Then after I told them that I liked it a lot more as I got through it, I think they persisted and agreed that it was better after getting closer to the end.

Central to the story is the newsworthy incident of August 7, 1974,when a daredevil of a man drew the world's attention by walking a tightrope between the towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. This is not a biography of that man however. He is completely fictionalized. Instead, this is the story of a handful of individuals who were effected by this event, some of whose lives were changed forever. It is also the story of New York City and how it was in 1974. I'm a New Yorker myself. I remember how it was back then. And I understand.

Much of the story is set in the slums of the Bronx where we meet two Irish immigrant brothers, both in their twenties. One of the brothers, Corrigan, is a celibate religious fanatic who befriends the prostitutes who ply their trade under the Major Deegan bridge. The other brother observes all this and tries to understand both his brother and the girls of the night whose stories come to light. This is just the bare introduction to the novel though and, after a tragic traffic accident which kills off two of the main characters, the story takes off in unique and surprising ways. We get to meet several mothers from different backgrounds who are all mourning the loss of their sons in Vietnam. We get to contrast life in a Park Avenue luxury apartment compared with life in the Bronx slums. We get to meet a former counter culture woman who has a terrible secret and wants to change her life. We even meet some early computer pioneers who hack into the phone lines near the World Trade Center during that famous tightrope walk. Then there is the judge who must make a decision as to how to sentence the tightrope walker as well as a 38-year old prostitute grandmother of two young babies. Yes, all these characters are there - big or bigger than life and completely developed.

The book is 349 pages and a fast read. It was hard for me to put down. And when I wasn't reading it, I keep thinking about it, feeling I knew each of the characters personally, remembering an earlier troubled New York City, and relishing all the details that the author used in order to tell this story. This is a really fine novel. Reading it is a roller coaster joy. Don't miss it!",0.4,negative review

McCann shows us so many of its characters, and he weaves their lives, their heartbreak, their happiness into a single narrative about a place and a people. The main thread of the story is the tight-roping incident, and it works well to hold the book together. I loved the main narratives of the two Irish brothers and mother-daughter pair, but the minor characters intrigued me just as much: the tagger, the judge, the computer programmers.

I did like the beginning of the book when it was centered in Ireland, but not long after that I began to lose interest. There was very little intersection of characters throughout the book and what little there was wasn't enough to get me excited.

Yes, there is a bit (just a bit) of a tie-in to some of the more ""distant"" characters at the end of the book, but it surely wasn't worth the effort to get to that point.

The most touching chapter, in my opinion, was ""Centavos""...and it was, by far, the shortest chapter in the book. (If you've decided not to read the book, it's worth going to the bookstore and just reading this chapter. It's a lovely, sentimental and touching remembrance of a just-lost love.)

"J. L. Rubenking (Cleveland, OH USA)","April 5, 2010",5.0,"This may be the best book of the year (for me) so far. Centered in New York city and the days surrounding the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center towers by Philippe Petit in August, 1974, McCann weaves a moving tale of people whose lives intersect in interesting ways.

There is Corrigan, a monk who provides creature comforts and a place to pee for the local whores, and his brother Ciaran, horrified by his brother's ministrations and circumstances until he sees beyond his initial impressions. There are the 'fallen women' too, Jazzlyn and her mother Tillie, both on the stroll but dreaming of anything better. Miles uptown, Claire Soderberg and her judge husband, Solomon, are still reeling from the death of their son in Vietnam. Claire meets with a group of other mothers who have suffered the same loss, but this is the first time she's hosting the meeting in her Park Avenue penthouse, and she fears rejection by the less rich group. Gloria, the only black member of the mothers group, discovers something new as well, about herself and others. Judge Soderberg surrounds himself in work and rituals, finding it hard to talk about his loss, even with Claire. And high above them all, the wire walker stuns and uplifts his watchers, and all of the characters find some connection to the idea of the man on the wire.

The writing is gorgeous, the chapters gracefully weave one character's narrative into another's. There is great sadness, but there are moments of humor and kindness, and always, compassion. I loved the characters and the story and setting. I can't summarize the wide-reaching plot, because it's not strictly linear and so beautifully compressed, and better experienced by the immersion of the reader. Well worth anyone's time.",1.0,objective review

"Joymarie ""Lover of the Written Word"" (United States)","March 29, 2010",5.0,"than a toddlin' town. Colum McCann's overview and underview of this truly complex city is a journey not to be soon forgotten.
It is about those looking up and those who dare not look down.

A speck on a line...just a break in the horizon between the newly constructed World Trade Center Towers. A man, Philippe Petit, daring to live his dream...daring to literally rise above by walking a tightrope between the towers. But not just walking. Jumping, lying down, running and enjoying the rush of freedom all around him. Will he make it? Will he attain his dream or will the tiny speck plummet to earth...

The on-lookers are those on their own tightrope perhaps one inch from the ground, looking up at him but walking their individual tightrope of dreams to who knows what end.

McCann uses the rope to tie together several individual lives of those looking up. Separate stories but held together by an iron cable swaying in the wind. Sadness, joy, trauma, despair, redemption, justice and injustice all bound together in a literary style far beyond my imagining. His prose flows like a melody, gliding from page to page...sometimes sonorous and sometime jarringly explosive. You become each of his characters in turn; rejoicing at times, suffering at others.

If perhaps, in one of my dreams, I could be both influential and affluent; I would see to it that this 'poetic' prose would find its' way to every young person. It's lessons are softly revealed; it's love and pathos overwhelming, it's tragedy heart-wrenching. Most importantly, it's message revealed as each page is pealed back to reside forever in our memories.

Read it...then read it again...and again ~ it only gets better.",0.5208333333333333,negative review
David Van Elslande (Belgium),"March 29, 2010",3.0,"I would recommend this book only for its middle section which is genius... but the trouble is that you need to read the rest of the book to fully comprehend its power.
The book is made of several stories intertwined, the focal point of which being Philippe Petit's walk on a wire between the 2 WTC towers in 1974.
It's another story about NY, a story about 9/11 (even if not mentioned, you can't escape thinking of it).
The wire journey is only 10-15 pages but is the most striking part of it (I discovered I could still get sweaty hands turning pages of a book), the other 400-some pages giving you a feeling of deja vu (there's so many other excellent, better , books about NY, about the past 30-40 years of western civilization out there), a very good deja vu but one nonetheless.
It's fast, stylish (a diet version of de Lillo ), easy to read, full of political correctness (I gotta say I'm pretty insensitive when it comes to reflexions on priesthood and their actions, whatever they might be) it's got all it needs to be a contemporary classic....but a classic, that'd be a long discussion. Guess we're still waiting for THE book about 9/11 (or is it already out there). In the meantime, I guess this one is not a bad place to start reading about it.
NB : get the ""man on wire"" DVD and watch it while reading ; on top of being a 5 stars documentary, it gives the book's climax a boost and, well...who would say no to that kind of feeling",0.9772727272727273,objective review

"Daniel Lewis (Benicia, CA United States)","March 27, 2010",2.0,"I am utterly bemused by the positive reviews this book has received. Cleary those who give this book more than one or two stars are seeing and experiencing the book through a different colored prism than I am. Only one novel was more completely unsatisfying than Let the Great World Spin, and that was Rohinton Mistry's A Fine Balance - but at least Mistry has some writing chops, has the ability to generate empathy and sympathy for his characters, talents of which Colum McCann is deeply bereft.

McCann utterly failed to fully flesh out his two central characters, Corrigan and Jazzlyn; he failed to create characters with depth and resonance. My favorite writers draw characters and create worlds for them to inhabit that stir my soul and imagination; they create people I can identify with, characters with motives I can understand even when I'm rooting against them. They create human beings who even when imperfect, deeply flawed, or evil, draw me into their psyches and then motivate me to understand them. McCann never achieves this with Corrigan and Jazzlyn. I never felt a sense of character intimacy with McCann's characters. I was glad to say goodbye to them. I Never sympathized with them. Compare McCann to Khaled Hosseini, who masterfully demonstrates what McCann doesn't in A Thousand Splendid Suns. When Mariam is forced to marry Rasheed, the older shoe cobbler from Kabul - a character as vicious a villain as Dicken's Fagin - I not only felt Mariam's pain, I simultaneously understood and sympathized with Rasheed. And while I could never forgive Rasheed's reprehensible behavior, I could appreciate the causal roots of his behavior, understand what drove him. I could identify with this despicable human being.

Compare McCann to Richard Russo. Russo is a master at creating characters who get inside you, a master at teasing humor from sadness (read Bridge of Sighs), a master at creating character intimacy and introducing you to people who live on in your imagination long after you've turned the last page of his books (read The Risk Pool). We can identify with Russo's characters because they so often evoke our own dashed hopes and dreams, highlight our own flaws and imperfections, and in so many ways reflect the longing, expectations, hopes, disappointments and failures of the collective American soul.

"Patti ""PattisPages"" (Atlanta, GA)","March 24, 2010",4.0,"If you saw the documentary Man on Wire, then you know that Philippe Petit strung a cable between the towers of the World Trade Center in 1974 and walked, skipped, and hopped across in the wee hours of the morning. This day and event ties together the stories of several New Yorkers, and even an amusing group of California computer hackers. Petit broke a few laws to accomplish his feat, and Sol Soderberg, one of a diverse cast of narrators, is thrilled to be the lucky judge who will preside over Petit's case. Meanwhile, Sol's wife Claire is clandestinely hosting a support group for mothers who have lost sons in Vietnam. Her Park Avenue apartment sets her apart from the other members, but in some ways she is the most tragic character in the book, in her lonely, desperate attempt to bridge the gap between herself and Gloria, an African-American woman from the Bronx. Gloria's neighbors include Corrigan, a monk struggling with his celibacy vows, a mother/daughter pair of prostitutes, and Corrigan's brother, recently arrived from Ireland. In this case, Gloria is the one walking the tightrope as she careens between the poverty of her neighborhood and her new friend Claire's opulent life. This started out as a snoozer, but I became more wrapped up in it as the narrators' intertwining stories started to click.

Having been enthralled with, Man on Wire, the film of Philippe Petit's tightwalking endeavors, I was excited to begin the novel which I assumed would be a straightforward fictional narrative of the public's reaction to Petit's feat of walking on air between New York City's World Trade Center's twin towers in 1974. I was so wrong. Colum McCann opens his novel with Petit's surreptitious and halting act, but in Book One moves to Ireland in the 1950's where we are introduced to a pair of brothers who we follow to NYC. The novel sways to and fro as did Petit on wire, from decade to decade, character to character, until the reader realizes they are all interwoven, characters and events affecting one another throughout the three Books which comprise the novel. Characters are developed, history is revealed, and culture is defined among the ruins of lives, unpredictable liaisons, and outcomes which I personally interpreted as positive in the end. I am not a linear thinker by nature, so I believe that I am the perfect audience for this very intricately commingled story about an assortment of individuals who are not as dissimilar as one would expect. If you're looking for an a-b-c-d format in this tale, you'll likely be disappointed.

(I've also enjoyed some of his earlier work.) And the characters in this novel are certainly decent also: despite their quirks and weaknesses, it's hard not to root for every one of them. But I'm afraid that my best wishes for both the author and his characters don't help my response to the book itself--which is, to put it simply, that I found it boring. I honestly had to work and work to finish this novel. I won't rehearse the plot of the book since you can find it in other reviews, but I think the conception (imagining the day of Philippe Petit's walk between the towers) was fantastic. The characters, as noted above, cry out for our sympathy. The ending is sweet. But somehow the whole piece, the way it tries to show the ""two degrees of separation"" that hold together a city, never holds together itself. In trying to manipulate the characters and their relationships through the complexity of their lives and this particular day, the novel feels more arranged than heartfelt: characters seem to have functions in a plot rather than lives in our imaginations. Scenes end up sounding like ""set pieces,"" where the prose sounds self-involved and the characters consequently artificial. Some tumble into stereotypes, and others seem less than complete (e.g., one character is said to belong to a religious organization simply referred to as the ""Order,"" as if this were a Dan Brown novel. Religious orders have particular names and identities, even if imaginary ones, so why not fill us in on this?).

Pete Nicholson,"March 12, 2010",5.0,"When books consistently change perspective, it can be annoying. Just as you get involved with some characters, a new chapter starts and you are supposed to start caring about some unfamiliar people and situations. However, when the author is a master of voice, like in this case with Colum McCann, you don't care. You go along with anyone he wants to introduce you to, and it takes about a page before you are immersed in the new perspective.

Let the Great World Spin keeps things popping. You get to meet a myriad of sharply drawn, distinct characters-- from Jazz a hooker ""on the stroll"" in the Bronx, to the judge who sentenced Philip Petit, to Corrigan (the most wonderful character of all-- an Irish immigrant attempting to fulfill a spiritual calling in the slums of NYC)-- and observe the overlap and interconnectedness of human experience. The shifts happen quickly and the story never drags.

It is also a period piece. You live and breath New York City in the early seventies which is a pretty interesting time and place to visit-- the graffiti writers, the drug use, the Vietnam hangover, the postmodern artists. The storytelling had that edgy dirtiness that I like, but is also touching and brings you to deeper themes about human frailty and the layered quality of our experiences.

Halfway through the book, the idea occurred to me that the theme of each story could be described in one word. So here goes:

The Irish monk, Corrigan -- temptation
Claire, who lost a son in the Vietnam war -- grief
The passenger in a hit and run incident -- guilt
The tightrope walker -- determination
The photographer of graffiti tags -- wonder
The computer hackers -- adventure
Tillie, mother of a prostitute -- remorse
Soderberg, the judge who tries the tightrope walker's case -- resignation
Gloria, who has lost three sons in the Vietnam war -- valor
The woman who lost Corrigan -- love
Jaslyn, who lost her mother many years before -- obligation

Middle,"March 7, 2010",3.0,"The concept is terrific -- capture New York City in the 1970's by detailing the lives of different city-dwellers on the day of Philippe Petit's performance between the World Trade Center towers and the way those lives intertwine. Unfortunately, in my judgment the book did not come close to living up to its ambition. Its setting in the New York of the 1970's is a matter of convenience and literary device--so that crime, the art/drug scene, and the Vietnam War can be discussed--but the book gives you no true feel for that era, much less Petit's feat. You will get much more of both the former and the latter from the extraordinary documentary Man on Wire. As for the short stories of the lives of the different characters, I found them generally stilted and artificial. It starts with a traditional Irish-suffering story which at least rang true, if not fresh. From there, the author attempts to inhabit the minds of prostitutes, young artists, a criminal court judge, four-star mothers of various backgrounds, and so on.

"Paul Frandano (Reston, Va. USA)","March 7, 2010",5.0,"This is a novel that takes in the whole world within the span of a single day in New York City that, like any day in any city, town, or hamlet, is filled with the ordinary and, sometimes, the extraordinary. McCann tells us the title of is book is lifted from Tennyson's ""Locksley Hall"" - ""Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range,/Let the great world spin for ever down the ringing grooves of change"" - in a couplet that points to the the novelist's universal ambitions. Leave it to an Irish storyteller to write so compelling an entry in the Great American Novel sweepstakes...it's pretty much here, and it's not - McCann's characters aren't straight out of GAN central casting, the whores don't have hearts of gold, he seems uninterested in predatory oligarchs. But he is indeed very interested in human predation, in the manner of Lu Xun, for whom ""eat people,"" or ""men eat men,"" is a distillation of human history. Despite this realization, the converse - redemption and ""valuing people"" - nevertheless happen.

The novel as grand verismo concoction: diverse New Yorkers, living their lives on a sweltering day in August 1974, when an aptly named wire-walker ambled across a 200-pound cable stretched between the twin towers of the World Trade Center. McCann has sacramentalized these ordinary lives that, like most lives, are fraught with circumstance and drama and are thus anything but ordinary. He lifts these stories up in a very secular way, despite the centrality of an extraordinary Irishman - an against-type ""whiskey priest"" whose humanity nearly overwhelms the book - interweaving the ""ordinary"" with the day's extraordinary event, raising the mundane to the nearly magical, the routine to the unique, and all against the towering backdrop of New York City. The author does so in palpable recognition that our cities are our universal places, our repositories of culture, history, mythology, dreams...the places where our great narratives are redacted and woven into the national tapestry, the meaning of which we argue endlessly.

The book is still sinking in, working like a time-release capsule, and I've already returned to it to reread passages of particular power or insight. It will almost certainly strike some readers as a narrative mess; it's told mostly in first-person, from numerous points of view, and is very close to a novel in stories. In turns, it's magical, brutal, closely observant, coolly distant, tremendously funny, and to my eyes a startling piece of writing by a young master who slides in and out of diverse characters and dialects as though he's lived his entire life in the native habitats of each...a power British novelist David Mitchell and very few others possess.

I'll conclude where McCann begins, with a quotation from Alexandar Hemon's wonderful The Lazarus Project, which McCann deploys as a promise to the reader: ""All the lives we could live, all the people we will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is what the world is."" It's a promise that, to me at least, Let the Great World Spin fulfills.",0.9679487179487178,objective review

E. Tabor (The Capital of the World),"February 28, 2010",5.0,"What a fabulous book! If you know Colum McCann's other work, then you know him to be a lyrical, entrancing writer, whose use of language is original and immensely satisfying and whose stories are also original and immensely satisfying. Mr. McCann is Irish, but he writes American stories that could only be written by one has had to observe us, and in doing so come to know us better than we know ourselves. That might sound trite, but when you read the book, you'll know what I mean. Mr. McCann shows an America that gleams, and even when it is corrupt, damaged and in pain, he gives us characters who are alive on the page, multidimensional, people we could know and might even want to. So now comes Let the Great World Spin, a novel about 9/11 that gets its power from when the Towers were still standing and the people affected by another event involving them, when Philippe Petit walked on a tight rope between them in 1972. As the links between the characters are forged, McCann develops a deep bass line that compels us toward our other 9/11 memories.

Nancy (Central New jersey),"February 26, 2010",2.0,"I wish I had spent the time reading a non-fiction book about Philippe Petit, the man who walked a tightrope between the twin towers. Instead I read about a somewhat sad bunch of people whose stories were loosely connected by the events of August 7, 1974. And indeed, their lives were intertwined in other ways that were revealed in vignettes (with somewhat jarring transitions between them). I felt the selection of characters was almost intentionally chosen to show the author's prowess for exploring diversity. Some of the prose was cutesy as well, particularly in the story of Claire, a grieving mother whose son was killed in Vietnam. I won't go into each story - I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader. And for me, it was exercise to keep going at times.

"Phlogiston (West Hartford, CT USA)","February 26, 2010",5.0,"This book is the very rare sort of novel that touches one so very deeply that one is not quite certain which world is more real, the world of the book or one's own world. Indeed, the line between the two worlds becomes a bit blurred.

Those of us who are old enough might remember the incident when a tightrope walker strung a wire between the two buildings of the World Trade Center and walked out onto it. This book takes place on that day, but instead of focusing on the man on the wire, who is so far above the bustling streets of the city, it focuses on those who are down in the dirt of New York, as it were. It is a book of everyman characters who are so extremely sympathetic, compelling and likable that, when conflicts arise, it is sometimes difficult to determine for whom we are supposed to be cheering. Perhaps the author does not want us to cheer. Perhaps he only wants to give us a window into their hearts, to see what drives them, what challenges them and to understand their successes and downfalls. This he does with vivid colors.

The book moves from one seemingly unconnected situation to another, but the author always manages to interweave the lives of the people in the story, such as to give the reader an amazing feeling for this incredible organism called New York. The lives of the people in the city and in the novel are connected, almost as if with tightropes, sending vibrations back and forth down the wire, while working to maintain one's balance, or, at times, giving up and allowing oneself to fall.

The tightrope walker may be at the apex of it all, but he is almost like the top of a pendulum. He is steady, angelic, above it all and around him there is so much more movement. All around him there is chaos, but out of this chaos emerges a kind of equilibrium.

This is one of the finest novels I have ever read. It is worth every second that one invests into it and is worth even a second or third read. For those who love New York, the 1970s, historical fiction or just a tremendous story, this one is a must. Get a copy.",1.0,objective review

As I've gotten older, I've discovered that required reading was intended to make me think, and now I actually enjoy it (who'd a thunk it).There is much to think about in this novel.
Foremost, in my mind is the author's choice of characters to write about. He has chosen to depict human fraility as resplendant with drugs, crime, veniality and personal arrogance. Yes, redeeming characteristics are present, but it is those on the fringe of society that the author wants us to think about and disect. Is it any wonder that our hero (Corrigan) dresses in black given the depressing portrayal of most of the characters. Is this a slice of life we need to spend time examining? I think so. My wife did not.
I can think of no higher compliment to an excellent writer than ""he/she has a way with words"" Colum McCann is such a writer, which makes reading whatever he writes worthwhile.

No need to reconstruct the plot, but a note of several of the characters. I found Corrigan, who was attempting to literally live his life based on the teachings of Jesus, especially interesting. The prostitutes Tillie and Jazzlyn were also so well drawn and so complicated. The addition of such chapters as the one about the computer hackers in California added to the tangled web of interconnectiveness of all these characters. Phillipe Pettit is actually a minor character in the novel, but is so interesting; the first chapter describing the ""walk"" is one of the most engrossing I have ever read.

I did find the ending to be a bit too much ""pulled together"" but still believable. Also, the relationship between the white society lady, Clare, and Gloria, the Black mother who also lost a son in Vietnam not as believable as the rest of the connections.

About halfway through it, I remarked that it may be one of the best books I have ever read. Now that I am finished I think I need to wait a couple of months and make sure I am certain before I proclaim it the best ever. It's a beautiful work.

McCann is so good at taking ordinary, boring lives, and transforming them in to fantastic tales of humanity and complexity. Especially impressive is his ability to tailor his writing style to a particular narrator. This is what leads, I believe, to the charges that the writing is disjointed at times. I remember one particular passage when a judge is talking about the crimes and cases that he sees in his court. For one entire paragraph, he lists many of the charges in one run-on sentence. Sure, this is a little hard to read, but I saw it as a fed-up over-worked man going on a hopeless rant of disparagement.

McCann does try to add a 'hook' to each character, like the poor black woman who loves opera, or the prostitute who reads Rumi. But instead of being racist or patronizing, I think he is trying to convey that even in the midst of hopelessness and despair, there is always something beautiful about every person's life. Yes, Gloria may have lost her sons and live in a neighborhood where she gets mugged, but she escapes to the opera where she can remove her shoes and lose herself in the music.

"M. J. Cotner (State College, PA)","February 7, 2010",5.0,"If this were a movie rather than a novel, it might look like the unlikely marriage of ""Man on a Wire,"" ""Crash,"" and ""I've Loved You for So Long"". The characters and their worlds are so compelling, it's as though Colum McCann has pulled out all of the English language's pastels, oils, charcoals, pencils, and watercolors to paint them - and then gently centered his pictures around the pivotal image of a man on a wire. The detail is wonderful - and the style (imagine a more focused, optimistic, male Lonnie Moore) a modern, measured flow of consciousness.

Another thing I loved about this novel is that while it clearly stands as a post-9-11 novel throughout, McCann never once actually mentions ""9-11"". Even as we become absorbed in another era, McCann's in-the-background focus on the towers holds us in the present. I hope this passage, one of my favorites, will give you a sense of what I'm trying to describe:

""He figured that the tightrope walker must have thought it over
quite a bit beforehand. It wasn't just an offhand walk. He was
making a statement with his body, and if he fell, well, he fell--
but if he survived he would become a monument, not carved in stone
or encased in brass, but one of those New York monuments that made
you say: *Can you believe it?* With an expletive. There would always
be an expletive in a New York sentence.""

"Dave Schwinghammer ""Dave Schwinghammer"" (Little Falls, Minnesota USA)","February 1, 2010",5.0,"Like many modern literary novels, LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN is stylistically annoying. There are at least a dozen major characters, and they all have their own point of view. Author Colum McCann also conforms to the Cormac McCarthy school of dialogue convention: a dash, rather that quotation marks. It also takes McCann a good two hundred pages to get all of his characters on stage and start making connections.

LTGWS starts with a tight-rope walker taking on the twin towers of the World Trade center in August of 1974. But the twelve characters are only tangentially related to this event. Some of them see it as it's happening. Others hear about it later. The action on the ground starts with an Irish monk named Ciaran Corrigan working with the prostitutes who parole outside the Deegan projects in the Bronx. He's atypical for a monk in that he doesn't preach and he doesn't try convert the prostitutes. He also endures several beatings from the prostitutes' pimps. A mother-daughter pair of prostitutes, Tillie and Jazzlyn Henderson, also carry quite a bit of the action. Gloria, a ""church lady"" who lives at the Deegan projects, becomes prominent in the story when Jazzlyn is killed in a car accident and Gloria volunteers to take Jazzlyn's children.

An obvious theme of the novel is that we're all connected. Gloria has lost her three sons to Vietnam. She attends weekly meetings where mothers who have lost sons take turns hosting sessions to commiserate. That's where she meets Judge Solomon Soderberg's wife, Clair. He just happens to be the judge who tries the tightrope walker for public endangerment. For me, the scenes with Gloria and Clair and the other grieving mothers were the most compelling. One lives on Park Avenue, the other in the Deegan projects. But the Deegan mother has more compassion in her little finger than the other ladies, who laugh at Claire when she hosts one of the sessions. A close second would be the scenes with Tillie Henderson, the thirty-nine-year-old grandmother prostitute. She is called before Judge Soderberg just before the tightrope walker. She is unintentionally disrespectful; he's tempted to stick her with a contempt of court fine, but notices all the reporters in his courtroom and doesn't want to come off like a jerk. This is the only funny part of the book. The scenes with Tillie in them jump off the page; she's both funny and heart-wrenching.

McCann is also saying something about art. He considers the tightrope walker an artist; he hops, does cartwheels, and runs across the cable, a hundred and ten stories above the street. He also spends a couple of chapters talking about the graffito taggers who work beneath the streets of New York, spray painting the subway walls, and the phone phreakers, who hack into the phone lines near the Twin Towers, trying to find out if the tightrope walker has survived. They are the first computer hackers, and they tie in with Claire's son who was a computer technician serving in Vietnam when he was killed. There are also a couple of real artists among the twelve point of view characters, one of whom leaves his paintings out in the rain, only to see art in what nature has done to a year's worth of work. McCann is having a bit of fun with this character.

One minor complaint. What's with the interview at the end of the book? Do we really need another ""literary"" author questioning McCann. After a while he begins to sound a lot like Jonathan Franzen, whose ""high art"" was too good for Oprah. Just put the interview in PUBLISHERS WEEKLY where it belongs. Also, if you're like me, you'll be wondering how Philippe Petit, the original tightrope walker, got that cable to reach across to the other tower. McCann finally tells you, but it takes him almost four hundred pages to do it.",0.9277777777777777,objective review
"A. T. A. Oliveira ""A. T. A. Oliveira"" (Sao Paulo","January 31, 2010",5.0,"In ""Let the world spin"", Colum McCann says in his Author's notes that the title of the novel comes from Alfred, Lord Tennyson poem ""Locksley Hall"", that was heavily influenced by ""Mu'allaqt"", or the ""Suspended Poems"" - Arabic poems written in the sixth century. At some point, the poems ask if `is there any hope that this desolation can bring me solace?'. That is exactly the main point in this beautiful, polyphonic novel: the solace that comes from desolation.

Set in the 1970's the narrative echoes the past into the present. It hardly mentions the events of 9/11, but, at the same time, that tragedy is always present throughout the story shaping how past turns into present. One of the main events of ""Let the great world spin"" is about French Philippe Petite and his walk between the twin towers of World Trade Center in 1974. This action has been the center of books and movies - specially a documentary called ""Man on Wire"" - but here is used in a fictional way. Many characters and their actions are related to this event in a loose way.

McCann - who happens to be Irish - asks how connected lives change one another. But what seems to be more interesting is the way that characters aren't aware of the thread that ties them to one another. Everything is connected. The various stories in this novels at some point converge. What doesn't mean that the narratives are plastered to a pattern - the connection may occur in the most subtle way - and, many times, only the reader is aware of it. A car crash is at the center of the collision - real and metaphorical ones. When two worlds collide both of them are about to change their route.

Routes will be drastically modified in the course of ""Let the great world spin"". What McCann shows is that the world spins no matter how we care or not about it. Like the course of lives that are always moving forward adding, however, the past. There are many narratives in this novel that prove so. Most of them begins somehow with Petite's walk. Like a spider web the author slowly develops a net of relationships, cause and effects.

The character development is strong - especially when it comes to emotional resonance. Some parts are told in first person, other ones in third person - these different techniques of narrative allow the reader to be closer to some characters than others. If fells like some of them are more open to show their inner emotions - therefore tell their own stories.

McCann, a very gifted writer, has developed a powerful elegiac novel about the world we live, the causes and consequences - most of them impossible to be understood - that affect our lives. In another reading, this is the best novel about the New York post 9/11. It is as powerful as sad as one expects it to be. In the end, the redemption, if it ever comes, it sure is stronger and more beautiful that it was supposed to be, because we have read about so many tales of the city - of this one or any other one.",0.96875,objective review

The central event of this book is a man walking across a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. I had no idea but this part of the book is true! The other sections of the book, I'm not sure what to call them because they just didn't seem like chapters each were about a different character. It reminded me of Olive Kitteridge: A Novel in Stories by Elizabeth Strout. While I enjoy this style of writing I think it did make it harder for me to get into the story. Once the character's stories started to overlap or I got the story of a character mentioned earlier on then it got interesting.

The characters were very unique and ranged from prostitutes to a rich lady living on Park Avenue. The relationships they shared were amazing and most unexpected. I think my favorite story was A Fear of Love. This was the first part of the book where the stories began to overlap.

"Charluke (Westchester, New York)","January 31, 2010",4.0,"Let the Great World Spin is a brilliant novel that reads as a collection of overlapping short stories. Some characters are more detailed than others, but each one is extremely complex and interesting. The majority of the novel takes place in the Summer of 1974 as the author returns throughout to the tightrope walk between the World Trade Center of Philippe Petit. It is through this act that we are able to tie most of the events to a particular day.

In each chapter, you are able to to get into the minds of characters who by the end of the novel, are all connected. The characters include John Corrigan (a monk/priest who is a friend and protector of a group of prostitutes who live outside his project), Corrigan's brother, Tilly and Jazzlyn (mother and daughter prostitutes), Gloria (the woman who adopts Jazzlyn's children), Claire (the wife of the judge who presides over the hearings of the tightrope walker, Tilly and Jazzlyn) and many others. The detail of the crime in New York City at this time is amazing, as are the descriptions of current events relevant to that time. The characters' reflections on their past makes each one come alive and, despite their flaws, you can't help but be moved by them.

It is interesting that Corrigan, who I believe is really at the center of this book, is never written in the first person. We learn of his short life strictly through how other characters viewed him. Even at the end of the novel, when we are taken to the year 2006, Jazzlyn's daughter is still reflecting on the life of Corrigan and wants to learn more about him.

If you are looking for a light read, this is not the book for you. It is, however, a book that will stay with you for days after you complete it.",0.9523809523809524,objective review
"A. Hennessey ""Art"" (Somerville, MA United States)","January 29, 2010",3.0,"Colum Mccann's novel is lyrical staccato with nifty observations and interesting characters. Like some other ""novels"" today, Let the Great World Spin is more like a collection of short stories linked together by some type of device. McCann's tapestry takes us through the sights and smells of 1970's New York City. A collection of junkies, immigrants, judges, artists and prostitutes make their way through the garbage and danger of Manhattan, while, high above it all, a mysterious acrobat walks a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers.

The stories intersect personally with two tragedies: the Vietnam conflict and an terrible car accident. The latter brings to mind the narrative fulcrum of the movie Crash. However, it is the living and breathing metaphor of the tightrope walker that gives the story its momentum and its real axis.

After a bravura opening that has almost the whole city stopping to observe a little speck walking out into the air between the towers, the novel suddenly shifts almost dizzily to Dublin - years earlier. Then, it fast forwards again and settles down into its gritty New York landscape and doesn't relent for a while. Indeed, McCann rubs our nose in the sights sounds and temperature of the tenements and their denizens with a kind of sadistic delight; things become very observational, and it is hard to get a read on what the characters want or desire. Here is where I felt the work stumbled.

This part of the book becomes a little bit of a slog. I put it down quite a bit and found I wouldn't pick it up for a while. I mention this only to assure readers that the novel does, in fact, pick up at around the half-way point. Every snapshot of the acrobat brings us closer and closer to him as the narrative and story lines begin to come together - the writer is back in command of his work again.

McCann employs a nice lyrical quality in some of the simple, sometimes sad, observations of his characters - some of whom do have that grating quality of over-characterization. (Hey, the prostitute knows poetry!) And in the end there is transcendent resonance between the artistry of the acrobat and way the love of human beings for one another can imbue moments with lasting significance.",0.8745833333333333,objective review

"Roger Brunyate ""reader/writer/musician"" (Baltimore, MD)","January 28, 2010",5.0,"Magnificently written, though slow to get started, this relaxed wide-ranging novel paints a number of vignettes of people in New York City on or just after August 7, 1974, when for three quarters of an hour Philippe Petit walked on a tightrope between the two towers of the World Trade Center. Most of the book concerns people on the edges of society -- an Irish monk who has come to work among prostitutes in the Bronx, a pair of struggling artists, a support group of mothers who have lost their sons in Vietnam -- though one of these is the wife of a judge living in a Park Avenue penthouse. There are also some wonderful side panels, such as a group of computer programmers in California cold-calling pay phones in NYC to obtain a first-hand account from people on the ground.

One word of warning. This is not a book to start (as unfortunately I did) if you do not have time on your hands. The early chapters are almost novella length, and apparently unconnected. Though totally absorbing in themselves, they do not yet provide much forward momentum. It is only halfway through, as the chapters get shorter and the connections between characters begin to emerge, that the richness of this multi-voiced tale becomes fully apparent, and the novel accelerates towards a quiet wrap-up of the 1974 events and a gentle epilogue 32 years later. In all, McCann shows an impressive stylistic range, held together by a deep non-judgmental humanity, making him a Tolstoy for our times.

I see that I am not alone in thinking of Tom Wolfe's THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES (1984), another New York panoply that brings together people from different walks of life; I am not sure if the expressway accident which plays a significant role in both books was intended as an oblique homage. But McCann's novel is less melodramatic, less tightly plotted, and not at all concerned with flaunting an insider status. Its relative looseness is indeed its strength, finding a quiet wisdom in everyday epiphanies. I am reminded too of the wonderful way in which Michael Cunningham wove almost-unconnected stories together in THE HOURS (1998), especially in the mood of its New York sections, and even more of what Virginia Woolf did for London in MRS DALLOWAY (1925).

Like Woolf, McCann also opens his book on a crisp sunlit morning, with a moment of wonder literally in the air. He uses it to focus and refract the lives of relatively ordinary people down below, and reveal their individuality that makes tham anything but ordinary. And although this is never explicitly mentioned, the book brackets the memory of another bright morning by the twin towers, when ordinary New Yorkers were once again shown in extraordinary light.",0.975,objective review

"James Hiller (Beaverton, OR)","January 26, 2010",5.0,"One city. One tightrope walker. A million lives affected, including this one.

Colum McCann's masterful mosaic, ""Let the Great World Spin"" is a collection of interwoven stories that seemingly are disconnected, but often many, unforced, beautiful connections. An Irishman seeking out his brother the priest, a group of Bronx hookers, an uptown woman mourning her son, a man daring to span two tall buildings, all play significant parts in this story, a story of many, many surprises. Writing from a multi-character perspective, McCann manages to inhabit even the most minor character, expanding it rapidly and creating an immense world of their own, sometimes within a few pages.

As I delved into this book (which isn't necessarily quick nor easy), the complexity of the story, as well as McCann's writing style, appealed. Somehow channeling his Walt Whitman side, McCann's listing and quick descriptions bring to life New York in the 70's, as well as the rich, inner interiors of the characters. It's that rich.

Upon finishing the last page, I so wanted to return to the first, which is a rare feeling for me. But I realized, in my haste to read this book, that I unintentionally ignored some characters, writing them off as minor, but in the end, are major, which, in itself, brings the idea of why do we diminish some characters and raise the profile of others?

"Richard A. Mitchell ""Rick Mitchell"" (candia, new hampshire United States)","January 25, 2010",5.0,"Simply put, this is a great book.

In 1974, Petit tight-walked across the chasm between the towers of the World Trade Center. He excited the imagination of the normally uber cynical New Yorkers. That has been the subject of its own books. Here, Mr. McCann uses that as the fulcrum for the story of several New Yorkers' lives. All are tangentially connected, but it is the individual stories that bind this book made up of chapters of varying length each devoted to a different character. The characters portrayed are as diverse as the city's population.

The book starts with a rather long biography of two Irish brothers who emigrate to NY. One is the story-teller, the other a monk of some questionable order who befriends the whores of the Bronx. The characters spin from there. There are chapters devoted to a whore, a judge, a mother of a son who died in Viet Nam, Petit himself (although never named), another mother of dead vets, a teenage photographer and a child of a prostitute. Each character study is unique unto itself, yet McCann does just enough to connect them.

There is another aspect of this book that is remarkable. Mr. McCann really captures the NYC of 1974 - the crime, filth and cynicism, while Park Avenue remained separate and apart.

No one does unhappiness like a good Irish writer, and Mr. McCann is a good, if not excellent, Irish writer. The reader has to look hard to find glimmers of hope and rejuvenation. They are there, but buried deep in the lives of these characters who all have their personal burdens and demons. Above it all, literally and figuratively, is Petit and his feat.

I was eager to read ""Let the Great World Spin"" and delighted to find the opening chapter following a tightrope walker about to begin his walk. I also enjoy inter-connected stories that shape a whole, such as those written by Amy Tan and Barbara Kingsolver. However, the voices in these novels, while varied, must be absolutely credible or the story drops.

While the chapters told from the elder Corrigan's point of view are extremely effective, other chapters aren't. The most telling example, for me, is Tillie's voice which is not only unconvincing but somehow veers toward stereotype. This essentially reduce the credibility of the character and breaks the tension that is created so effortlessly in other parts of the book.

I should have been with the tight-rope walker on the wire, running into the arms of the police officer. I should have identified all the other tightrope walkers who have wandered in and out of the story and are meant to tie the story into a complete whole.

The totality of a great novel should exceed the sum of its parts. For me this book fell short of that standard. Somehow it was structurally hollow at its core. A series of vignettes, each exquistely depicted and remarkable in its own right, but collectively failing to deliver a seismic impact. McCann, like Philip Petit, the tightrope walker who inspired the novel, struts his stuff high in the air. His writing is beautiful: it demonstrates abundant skill and sensitivity. It enthralls. But strangely the totality fails to deliver an overarching emotional or intellectual impact. In the final chapter McCann attempts to tie together all that has come before and provide it with current relevance but, jarring and ineffective, it doesn't work.

Colum's goal is to place the reader inside the shoes of people who walk the wire on a daily basis.

So many people making so many tragic choices! It wasn't pleasant reading, and it was pretty frustrating and depressing for long stretches. There were a few bright spots though. Let me just talk about a few of the characters that I found most compelling, without giving too much away.

Corrigan is a priest, but his faith in God is twisted and pretty toxic. He never seems to understand God's extravagant love, grace, and mercy. I was pulling for him to realize how much God loves him, but I don't think he got there. There is a lot about Corrigan to admire though. He took care of the lowest of the low -- strung out prostitutes -- but it felt more like they were dragging him down, rather than him lifting them up. Still, there is good food for thought in Corrigan's story. What does faith in action look like?

Gloria is an educated, African American woman, who lost three sons in Vietnam. There is a lot to respect and love about Gloria. She takes in two young girls after their mother dies in a car accident. The little girls, it seemed, were doomed to repeat the mistakes of their prostitute mother and grandmother. But Gloria rescues them from all of that. We get the satisfaction of seeing that she really did change the trajectory those girls were on. She saved them. In a tangential storyline, Gloria befriends a woman from a Park Avenue penthouse who was deeply depressed by the loss of her own son in Vietnam. In a way, Gloria saves her too. It begs the question, does anybody in your life need to be rescued today?

I finally got around to it while I was stuck on a plane with nothing better to do, and it surprised me.

The book is almost like a series of short stories, but the overlapping characters and plot lines pull it together to form a cohesive novel. Two of my all time favorite novels (Cloud Atlas: A Novel and Ghostwritten) use a similar technique, so I couldn't help but compare it to them. When I read those books, I found them very compelling; I always wanted to jump into the next section to see what would happen and how the stories would connect. For some reason, though, this book did not have quite the same affect on me. I enjoyed the book, but I rarely felt a strong pull to pick it up again after setting it down.

Although I didn't find it compelling as my two favorite novels, I did still enjoy reading it. I really liked the way McCann took several simple stories and developed them by connecting them to one another and illuminating multiple perspectives. There were several times when the novel surprised me by returning to another story or character and totally changed my understanding of it by offering a new perspective (while keeping it consistent with the original story).

My biggest criticism is with the final chapter. Most of the novel takes place in 1974, but the last chapter jumps ahead to 2005. I found McCann's portrait of NYC in 1974 fascinating, but his return to the near-present was jarring for me. He seemed determined to include every possible contemporary theme (post 9/11 airport security, Iraq/Afghanistan, carbon footprint, etc.) in order to make his novel relevant. But since he didn't have time to deal with each issue in just one chapter, he just mentioned each briefly and moved on. That being said, I did enjoy the storyline of the final chapter and seeing what had happened to the character(s) included.

"Chris R. Hotz ""Regular Guy reviews"" (Greenwood Village CO)","January 2, 2010",4.0,"I found Let the Great World spin to be an interesting series of intertwined stories. The book has a poignant melancholy about it, as all the stories involve tragic loss. But at the same time, the author does a nice job giving glimpses of human beauty, even in those who society generally discards.

The intertwining stories are loosely connected by a tight rope walker who illegally walked between the newly built, but not yet completed World Trade Center towers in the 1970's (the movie Man on Wire documents his feat. Pretty amazing). The connection never really worked for me. I struggled understanding how the wire walker had anything to do with the characters; it seemed like the author picked an event out of a hat and just went with it. I suppose the wire walker cements the story in a specific period when the twin towers represented hope and promise prior to their demise on 9/11, but the connection to the actual characters was clumsy. Some reviews call this a 9/11 book, but that seems anecdotal, as only the final section takes place post 9/11, and even that does not draw any connection between the characters and the twin towers.

Some of the mundane stuff in this book is drawn out too long, as the author appeared to be more worried about each descriptive word he used than tying the plot together. I expected a little more intrigue in how these vastly different lives diverged.

So all in all, this a well written book that brings the reader into the lives of diverse and interesting characters; but that is about as far as it goes. As a story...its just so-so.

As I was reading this book, savoring the language, I felt deeply satisfied in the sense of something filling my soul. I am not gifted at literary review; I am not an editor. I can only say that the writing of this book seems extraordinary, a rare thing. I just now watched the clip of Colum McCann on this site, and he speaks of ""channeling"" the voices of the characters and of acting as a ventriliquist. He succeeds expertly at channeling disparate voices--and so many of them--from different races, socio-economic standing, and from different places--Ireland, Guatemala, and the United States (he seems to have New York City down pat and then there was Gloria with her Missouri roots). He made me love these people, these very different people. He helped me understand and also care about hookers in the Bronx, about a struggling single mother from Guatemala, and a judge in NYC who's life was not all it seemed to be once McCann helped us see beneath the veneer. These people are believable, both in the way they talk and the way they think, their interior lives. This is an outstanding book. I am not the first to say so; I just wanted to add my thoughts and thanks to so many others'. Congratulations to Mr. McCann for this amazing work of art!",0.9615384615384616,objective review

"David MacCallum ""David H. MacCallum"" (New York City, NY)","December 16, 2009",5.0,"Let the Great World Spin has many layers going on within it.

On the top layer, it is a book about New York in one moment in its long, difficult history, the 1970's. This was a time of urban decline for our Big City, rapidly emerging class distinctions, grinding poverty and desperation, and increasing emotional and economic distance between New York's residents. This theme is brillantly laid out in a series of snapshots of the urban situation, each of them perfectly drawn.

In the next layer, one that unfolds relentlessly and almost silently, these strands draw closer together, providing the novel with its momentum and power. We become aware of the randomness of events that draw human lives together. The pieces fit together beautifully: an Irish social worker with a driven sense of the power of religion to change lives, prostitutes, a Park Avenue socialite reaching for a deeper meaning to life, children of privilege who have descended into confusion, and, above it all, a most fantastic tightrope walker.

It is he, the tightrope walker, whose long, langorous walk in the sky above the World Trade Towers, provides the real glue, the most important layer, in the story. This single act of daring and danger transfixed New York, all of its citizens, in one magical moment in those distant 1970's. New York was presented with a phenomenal act of achievement, soaring high above the ground, alone, contemptuous of authority, detached from all the rules of urban life, thrilling in the frightening challenge to normality. This, in a sense, is the story of this novel. Colum McCann does what few novelists in my 60 year history of reading fiction have done: this book speaks louder and louder to us as it proceeds; it provides us with a picture of what really is happening all around us in life as we draw together and apart, as we try so hard to find our way, alone most of the time but in the end very much together.

I had never read anything by Colum McCann but this has to be the first of many others that i shall read.",0.9913333333333334,objective review
Mark Stevens (Denver),"December 13, 2009",5.0,"Nothing is entirely by itself.

As a theme, that has ""trite potential"" written all over it. In the hands of Colum McCann, the theme is treated masterfully and with care.

The observation, that ""nothing is entirely by itself,"" comes from Gloria as she's leaving a gathering of women who have lost sons in Vietnam. ""Each thing as strange as the last, and connected,"" she concludes.

Those connections are bound together by Philippe Petit's mind-boggling tightrope walk between the World Trade Centers in 1974. That's the common thread--or wire--that loops through these stories. The loop is loose at first, then grows tighter and cinches up neatly, after the book has shot its last story-arrow up and over the War in Iraq, at the end. Too neatly? This is probably a matter of how sweet you like your endings. I vote yes. It feels entirely real and it leaves you with a ray of hope that human connections do make a difference.

McCann enters the worlds of each of his main characters with ease. We are inside Petit's head (though Petit is unnamed) and inside the head of a Jesuit priest, a prostitute, a judge, an artist, and a Park Ave. woman of means. I enjoyed all the writing and the shift in voice and tone from character to character, but Claire Soderberg is particularly well drawn. Her grief is palpable. She's one of several mothers who have bonded over the loss of their sons in Vietnam and, when we meet her for the first time, is about to host the group at her relatively fancy apartment for the first time.

""How to greet? Handshake? Air kiss? Smile? The first time around they had hugged good-bye, all of them, in Staten Island, at the doorstep, with the taxi beeping, her eyes streaked with tears, arms around one another, all of us happy, at Marcia's house, when Janet pointed to a yellow balloon caught in the treetops: Oh, let's meet again soon! And Gloria had squeezed her arm. They had touched cheeks.""

MCann's characters pinball off each other and we begin to see how their lives overlap too, how the small decisions in one setting lead to the consequences in the next. I found McCann's descriptions detailed, rich and inviting. The dialogue was just as sharp.

""Let The Great World Spin"" is symphony and engages a wide range of players, all relying on each other to produce one big sound. I couldn't agree more with the awards heading McCann's way.

"Miami Bob ""Resurgent Reading"" (Miami, FL United States)","December 10, 2009",5.0,"Literature portrayed as mosaic is phenomenal, and even seems better when delivering a pretty or happy message that people - each full of human frailties and weaknesses - can be the cause of great endings.

Corrigan (who ignores his first name) encounters a divine calling in grade school to tend the poor. Leaving his native Ireland for America, we learn about his impoverished life in rugged Bronx where he befriends the local street walkers - most particularly Tillie and her daughter Jazzlyn.

From there we learn how people who cause great stress and strife to Corrigan, Tillie and Jazzlyn can become the closest friends to those closest to he and Tillie and Jazzlyn. Even a marriage emanates. And eventually good things come to Jazzlyn's two daughters who become model citizens and leave the streets which imprisoned two previous generations of their maternal family.

McCann may be saying that good people are reared, not born. The mother and grandmother of the innocents are no less good in the core - but being subjected to cruelty or not being as properly reared - they end in the opposite spectrum of their granddaughters or daughters.

Like the movie Crash, we learn the fate for some can cross cultural, economic and other barriers. And, within clouds are silver linings. This book does not preach that good prevails over bad, it just recites how good can come from bad.

In the end, we all must die. And as one old woman cleverly states, "". . . she was tired of everyone wanting to go to heaven, nobody wanting to die."" But, when we learn the equality of man in the relative bizarre world of fate, does not the end result also happen with equality - the same for all? I think Colum McCann was implying that streetwalking grandmother or samaritan-adoptive parent who touched the lives of the girls probably will be at the same steps of afterlife to greet the children - if there is an afterlife.

"scott89119 ""scott89119"" (CA)","December 8, 2009",5.0,"McCann's novel-in-stories is a big, sloppy, urgent, bittersweet, hard-edged, sentimental look at a group of people trying their best to live in New York City in the 1970's.

"Ismail Elshareef ""ielshareef"" (Los Angeles, CA United States)","December 7, 2009",5.0,"This book is already a classic! It's not only beautifully and lyrically written, but its characters with all their achingly palpable pain, heartbreaking innocence and infectious optimism are impeccably drawn.

Colum McCann writes an epic tale of New York City on the 7th of August in 1974. Anchored in the quicksand of corruption and crime and Vietnam, the City looks up to the sky and observes Philippe Petit walk between the World Trade Centers on a tightrope, as free as the sinking City will never be.

The event is the lynchpin that holds the book together as it tells the story of various interconnected characters: two Irish brothers living in the Bronx and the Black prostitutes they call ""friends,"" a Park Avenue judge and his wife that just lost their only son to war, a group of women mourning their lost sons, four young engineers in Palo Alto hacking fledgling networks, two young artists high on cocaine and delusional grandeur. They live, love, hate, cry, laugh, sell, buy, learn, spit, swear, pray, smile, shoot up, give up, take off, get off, sweat and die as the man above them--an angel, really--live out their true desire to be free, completely unaware they even existed down below; down in the gutter.

True to the City they roam, every character in this book has a strong opinion of the man high above them. Some admire him and some resent him. Some don't care enough one way or the other because shenanigans like that were banal and commonplace at best.

One of the characters is Corrigan--an Irish Jesuit Priest who moved from Dublin to New York City in the pursuit of God. He's not looking for any God, he wants ""a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday."" What he ends up finding instead is social calamity and destitution. A city rotting from the inside out.

Corrigan is an innocent dreamer with pure ideals and impossible optimism. Ravaged by the City's embrace, he never once let up. ""The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth-the filth, the war, the poverty-was that life could be capable of small beauties.""

Claire--another incredible character in the book--is actively mourning the death of her only son in Vietnam when she hears about the man up high in sky and thinks he's ""so flagrant with his body. Making it cheap."" She resents the man for inviting death at a time she was trying to understand it but couldn't; understand its infinite forms, ""death by drowning, death by snakebite ... death by memory loss, death by claymore ... death by paper cuts, death by whoreknife, death by poker game ... death by authority, death by isolation, death by genocide, death by Kennedy ... death by signature, death by silence ... death by performance.""

I will stop and let you discover this special book on your own. Although the story takes place in NYC, it is deeply and commonly American. The early 1970s was uniquely transitional in American history. That's when America lost its innocence, and NYC exemplified that in every way.

Having said that, this is also a very NYC story. Colum's descriptions brought the bankrupt city of the '70s to life and captured its enduring spirit in a way I never realized possible.

"Richard Pittman (Toronto, ON Canada)","December 2, 2009",4.0,"I finally got around to this year's National Book Award Winner. For me, the NBA is hit and miss where I've loved some choices (Shadow Country), very much disliked some (The News From Paraguay) and felt neutral on others (The Echo Maker).

I liked Let The Great World Spin quite a lot. This is despite the fact that I didn't like the structure of the novel very much. The structure was very much like the movies ""Crash"" or ""Babel"" or ""Traffic"". There are a series of stories of normally unrelated people who intersect over a period of time with an event linking these stories. I find the format a bit gimmicky.

The binding event in Let The Great World Spin is a man who walks on a tightrope between the World Trade Center Towers in 1974. It is another extraordinary event in New York. The stories are of New Yorkers from various walks of life and backgrounds who either see or hear about the tightrope walker on that day. The stories are not just limited to that day but all seem to come back to it.

There are quite a few stories told in the first person from different perspectives. The first and probably most significant is of the Corrigan brothers from Ireland. The key character is John Corrigan (Every one calls him by his last name, even his brother Ciaran). Corrigan is someone searching for meaning in life. He basically sacrifices his own comfort to help others. He lives in the South Bronx and lets the local hookers use the washroom in his apartment. He brings them coffee and is human to them. He also helps out at the seniors home and is generally a force for good in the world. He is unperturbed by pimps beating him up and all other forms of harsh circumstances. He's a very unique and compelling character.

A second main thread tells of Claire a rich wife of a judge who lives in a Park Avenue Penthouse. Her son has died in Viet Nam and she has bonded with several other mothers who have also lost sons. She strikes up a particularly deepm realtionship with another woman who has lost three sons in Viet Nam. Their friendship endures despite their very different backgrounds (Affluent White on Park Avenue vs non-affluent African American woman living in the SOuth Bronx.)

There are other story threads but generally they relate back to and cross with the first two stories.

Each story is very thoughtful and deals with a range of human emotions and circumstances. The story is a very good slice of New York life in 1974. Both the characters, the city and the time are the stars of the novel.

I enjoyed this a great deal and recommend it. I do agree with other reviewers that it is a little slow at first but gets steadily better.

"M. Feldman (Maine, USA)","December 1, 2009",5.0,"When you enjoy a novel so much that you're hunkered down under the covers with a reading light, trying not to wake your spouse while you finish the book, it's hard the next morning to think analytically about WHY you liked it. So-so books are easier to dissect. I recalled that the author of ""Let the Great World Spin,"" Colum McCann, commented in an interview that the car crash depicted in the novel, which impacts so many lives, is patterned, in its small way, on the destruction of the World Trade Center. McCann said he was drawn to the way the fallen towers drew together people who, until linked by suffering, might otherwise have had nothing at all in common. His statement helped me understand the genesis of the novel, but not why it is so good. However, I'll try.

To me, it is McCann's use of detail, often the same detail repeated or changed slightly, that makes his characters so compelling. Jazzlyn, the teenaged prostitute who works in the shadows cast by the Major Deegan Expressway, is defined by the neon swimsuit she wears. When she is picked up in a police raid, it flashes beneath the coat her protector, Corrigan, has thrown over her. In court, Jazzlyn is inarticulate; her few words are inappropriate and reveal little about her. To the judge and to the onlookers, she is one more degraded woman in a weary procession. To the reader, however, the bathing suit suggests everything we know about her--her beauty, her youth, her recklessness. Her mother, Tillie, carries a pink parasol. It is by turns, coquettish, ironic (in the way it evokes the high class courtesan Tillie isn't), and, finally useless. It has no function as protection or even shade; Tillie can't protect herself, her daughter, or, in the end, her daughter's children. The Trade Center funambulist (tightrope walker) based on Philippe Petit is defined by his wire: the composition of it, the laying of it, the defects that can render it fatal, the precision of its tension. And Corrigan, the figure at the center of it all, speaks through his body: there is the thinness of his frame, visible through the ragged collarless black shirt that hints at his religious vows, then the blotches on his body that signal disease, and, finally, the image of those thin ribs pressed up against the steering wheel. All of the other characters in this polyphonic novel, in which characters appear and reappear, sometimes quite unpredictably, express more with their gestures, their clothing, their living rooms, all the details of their lives, than they ever do with words.

The premise of ""Let the Great World Spin"" is that people are bound to others in ways they can't always predict or even see. This is the motif created by the interwoven depictions of the high wire act, itself a blend of faith, crazy daring, and freedom. Sometimes in the novel fragile connections lead to a lessening of loneliness, sometimes they don't. I don't know if the novel's premise is even true, but reading this book and its surprising ending, so far (and yet not so far at all) from its beginning pages, made me believe for a time that a wire could stretch between a drug-riddled housing project in the Bronx and an elegant apartment on Park Avenue.",1.0,objective review

"Richard A. Jenkins ""Richard A. Jenkins"" (Washington, DC USA)","November 29, 2009",3.0,"As others have noted, this is an overlapping set of stories given some unity by a tightrope walk in New York City. The actual heart of the book is a set of stories that involve an Irish monk living in the projects in the Bronx. Involved with him are his brother (newly arrived from Ireland), a mother-daughter team of streetwalkers, a woman who becomes the love of his life, and assorted pimps, sex workers, and clients at a nursing home. Other characters include members of a support group for parents of Vietnam War casualties, a judge, and the tightrope walker. People old enough to have some memory of 1974 will recognize many pop culture cliches in the book: the well-intentioned liberal judge worn down by bureaucracy and criminal recidivism, a prostitution culture that owes a little too much to Blaxploitation films, and the kind of unconventional true believer clergy who briefly flourished in the Vatican II era. The monk is the most fully drawn character in the book, with failings and heart. The other characters tend toward the one-dimensional. In some places, McCann seems to race through character development as in the case with woman who adopts the children of the younger streetwalker. The interior lives of the characters are largely told to us rather than naturally unfolding. This kind of thing works well enough in a short story, but seems rather didactic and unconvincing in a novel. McCann seems to have researched many details like the location of Cleveland's 1970s downtown prostitution stroll, but his portraits of Park Avenue and the South Bronx seem like movie set pieces rather than real places. The opening chapter (which set-up the tightrope walk) and the overlapping narratives seem tailor made for an ensemble independent film and perhaps that medium could give the life to this story that McCann's book lacks. The National Book Award panel seems to reward unusual narrative styles; unfortunately, in this case, they've rewarded a clumsy attempt at novel length short story fiction. Despite its unevenness, I did manage to finish the book, but it wasn't as satisfying as many far less ambitious and gimmick-ridden novels.",0.9038461538461539,objective review

McCann is a great writer, capable of spinning some beautiful prose, but he is also capable of clunky schmaltz. Every time I came across a particularly flowery sentence I just wanted to groan -- which is not a great recommendation for a book. There are moments of brilliance, but they get bogged down in stories that are wildly varied in terms of quality. It is also disappointing that the centerpiece of the collection -- Philippe Petit's walk between the towers -- feels so marginal and insignificant in parts. I frequently felt disinterested in the stories and the lives depicted, so it took me a long time to slog my way through. Ultimately, I can see why people like this book, but I am surprised that it has garnered as much praise as it has. It's good, but in my opinion it is definitely not great.

If you are a fan of the short story format, I think you will enjoy this book too. I had to put the book down for several weeks and was able to easily get back into it. So that was convenient, but each chapter and 'book' was a story in it's own right. The high wire act serving as a connecting thread throughout. More interestingly was the 'intersection' of the stories and the lives therein and how McCullum was able to maintain the surprises through to the very end. If you enjoyed any of the following stories, I tink you would also like this book: ""I know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" by Maya Angelo; ""Beloved"" by Toni Morrison, ""The Brief Wonderous Life of Oscar Wao"" by Junot Diaz.

Savvy,"October 15, 2009",4.0,"McCann is Irish, but he writes about New York with such a critical knowledge and understanding of the city's many layers and cross sections of the populace that is truly amazing.

By interweaving the story of The Man of The Wire throughout the novel (somewhat Olive Kitteridge-ish style), he brings us to meet real people, each with their own demons, visions, mysteries, pains and pleasures. It's a multi-layered microcosm of New York City in the 1970's.... a series of short stories told from different viewpoints that are all interconnected the way people are interconnected.

The 'man on the wire' is central to the story, but his walk isn't the only force driving the novel. The book focuses on people and how they come together across lines that otherwise divide them.
A spinning together and how lives touch other lives in sometimes random ways.

Exploring how differently we all cope with the wires we walk, the spinning we encounter. Where we came from...where we are going...how to find the humor in even the most desperate situations.

This is what comes alive and resonates deeply in LET THE GREAT WORLD SPIN.... a wonderfully crafted novel!",0.33333333333333337,negative review
"Reader and Writer ""Chris"" (Canada)","October 8, 2009",3.0,"I don't agree this is brilliant or best ever as I've read here. I'll voice my opinion but note I'm prejudiced because he teaches where I also used to teach (different department -- never met him).
The book feels like a collection of short stories that were tweaked until they became a bunch of short stories loosely held together. One can pretty much identify the parts that appear added to link them.

I liked much of the writing, in parts it flew, in parts it seemed a bit contrived. McCann certainly does not possess the Tolstoy-an espertise for knowing just how long to make a section. Most of the characters end up speaking about the same as one another with a few different words but a pacing and line length that blends into one voice, that of the author. One chapter and voice is different because it starts out slangily but then it shifts in and out of the slang as the chapter continues.

It's not bad at all, but it's not really great either. It is a mildly amusing plodding along story. The design of the plot of stories all centering around the wire walk is really wonderful. Overall though about half the stories strike a daring balance on the high wire, the other ones...well don't look down.",0.25,negative review

No such luck. I resent the time I gave up to wade through all the showy and showoffy writing (though some of it is genuinely good: just enough to keep you hoping.)

Nim Sudo,"September 10, 2009",5.0,"This book is more like a collection of interrelated short stories than a novel. Each chapter introduces a new character, usually related to the previous characters. They are all connected via their relation to the historic moment when Philip Petit walked a tight rope between the twin towers of the world trade center, shortly before their completion in 1974.

The chapters vary in style and quality, but the good ones are really very good. The author uses beautiful poetic, emotional language, and the strong parts of the book range from ecstatic to heartbreaking. The beginning of the book is a bit slow, but I recommend that you stick it out for at least the first quarter. If you haven't been moved by that point (which is hard for me to imagine), then this book is not for you.

More about the language: The book is written in a staccato style. Lots of sentence fragments. Sometimes more like poetry than prose. Not always making sense. But beautiful. Sometimes I felt that the language was not entirely authentic, that is sometimes it did not sound like a New York novel, but rather an Irish novel about New York. But this can be forgiven.

I have heard it claimed that this book is a 9/11 novel. I don't buy it. It has the world trade center and it has tragedy, but aside from that I can see no relation to 9/11. However it is still a beautiful book.",0.988095238095238,objective review

"Stephen T. Hopkins (Oak Park, Illinois)","August 28, 2009",4.0,"Colum McCann's new novel, Let the Great World Spin, presents the voices of multiple characters connected in ways that prove that even in a huge city like New York, we live in community and have an impact on the lives of those around us. The voices of multiple characters present dimensions of a time in 1974 that are true to that time and remind us of our lives today. Tying together each voice is the highwire stunt of Philippe Petit when he walked on a tightrope between the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. The cast of characters presents the city and the community in its fullness: young artists; hookers on drugs trying to raise children; a street priest; a Park Avenue judge; a support group of women who lost sons in the Vietnam War. Love, sorrow, redemption and understanding fill the pages of Let the Great World Spin. As McCann notes on page 349, ""The world spins. We stumble on. It is enough."" However you stumble along in this world, one or more characters will resonate with you and your life.

"Brian Lange (Chicago, IL)","August 27, 2009",3.0,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. Instead, I found was a collection of arbitrary thought all muddled together encompassed by one or two centralized themes.

From the start of this book, I disliked the style of writing. At first I thought it like Stephen King's obsessive description of banal detail. Then I thought Kerouac and his three word mundane sentences. This happens. That happens. This exists. This is bad. This exists. They are there. I am here. At times I found the flow of Eggers or Sedaris, but I couldn't get incredibly interested in the story or it's characters. There seem to be just a bucketful of stories, as I said before, all muddled together in hopes of it being tied together in a neat little bow.

There are sometimes contemporary, historical, or pop-culture references that sometimes hold me into the section for a little longer, but all in all I was rarely engaged and did not feel it to be a page turner. I like certain relationships the protagonist has with the people he meets. I like the places he goes to visit, but for me the biggest flaw was in the non-descript style of writing. In my opinion it seems as though the writer can not find his voice, and it is not conducive to the story(ies) at all. There was no flow.

More than an economic mess, New York had everything else going against it, or so it seemed, and McCann wonderfully captures the seediness and the grit through his characters of immense variety. And for one brief moment, Philippe Petit soared over Manhattan, literally forcing New Yorkers to look skyward. With that central theme, McCann begins a six degrees of separation that largely succeeds.

Is this a book that can easily be picked up from time to time? Yes. While the characters in his novel are extraordinarily crafted and McCann's descriptions attract as much as they reek, large sections of ""Let the Great World Spin"" are given over to lengthy dialogue that slows down the narrative.

"JackOfMostTrades ""Jack"" (Washington, DC)","August 6, 2009",3.0,"Perhaps if I hadn't read and heard about this book via the various media outlets, including listening to an interview with the author, I wouldn't have been let down as much as I was. However, I was. I believe the author has a sincere agenda and writes from the heart, but his mastery of English prose unfortunately does not seem up to the ambitious ideas and structure of the book. The book's theme--at least from my perspective--is wonderful. It's too bad the writing weren't any better. Specifically, McCann's style seems to be just a bit 'off.' He almost gets 'le mot juste,' but it just isn't enough. He almost gets New York dialogue down--whether it's of the South Bronx variety or the 5th Avenue 'friends of Central Park' style of discourse. But the writing seems too studied, as though he were given a writing assignment and hasn't done a re-write yet. I lived in NYC for a long time, and was there on the day of the famous 'skywalk', but New York just isn't like that and wasn't like that. If you compare the skill of Richard Price or George Pelacanos for dialogue writing, you will immediately see the difference between getting urban dialogue right and not. Additionally, the novel suffers from too much exposition/inner thought process dialogue--running monologues that comment on the action of the characters by the characters themselves. This is fine if it works, but it just seems to get in the way. For example, we learn a lot about the self-consciousness of a society woman when her support group--made up of working class women--when they come to her apartment for a meeting. It's the usual, 'oh I hope they don't think I'm stuck up, etc...' but really, it's quite obvious from the situation.The action and dialogue should be enough to convey this, but McCann seems afraid the reader won't get it. This was Hemingway's strength. He made the reader get the point by showing the characters in action. It seems McCann has to broadcast it. This really isn't a literary novel. Not anymore than episodes of Law & Order are cinematic masterpieces. And the cop show doesn't make an implicit claim to be what it's not. But if you do like shows like Law & Order, you will probably like this book.

Now the theme--at least the way I read it--is terrific. In a way the story is an attempt to temper history by presenting lives surrounding a famous moment in history that involved the Twin Towers. Here, the act is a celebration of life, the human spirit, the desire to transcend the body and let the soul fly. This is basically the opposite of the associations we have -- and rightfully so -- of that other event that involved the Twin Towers. If only the writer had had more skill, it might have served this noble purpose. Given its imperfections, however, I think the writer would have been better served by making this salve of language into an extended essay, because that's where exposition is better suited. Now before you think I'm a blue meany or miscreant, read or re-read the review of Publisher's Weekly on the home page of this book. It is a positive review, but at the end, note the following:

""McCann's dogged, DeLillo-like ambition to show American magic and dread sometimes comes unfocused--John Corrigan in particular never seems real--but he succeeds in giving us a high-wire performance of style and heart. (June)""

The only difference in that assessment and mine is that to me it's not just John Corrigan (hip-Catholic priest-brother of narrator character) is unfocused and never seems real; pretty much all the characters do.",0.9102564102564104,objective review

"L. Quido ""quidrock"" (Tampa, FL United States)","July 28, 2009",5.0,"The inspiration for Colum McCann's tale of `70's New York City is Philippe Petit's tightrope walk, strung between the now gone Twin Towers. People too young to have lived at that time will be jolted at the thought of such a walk...those of us who were kicking around the universe at that time will unravel a small germ of a memory and try to remember where we were when we heard the news of Petit's quirky, death-defying journey that summer day, now 35 years ago.

McCann takes this centerpiece of his tale to weave short vignettes of observers lives, observers in that NYC melee that day, kaleidoscopically trailing lives through shadows of other lives. Populated with priests, prostitutes, grieving mothers, socialites, judges, immigrants and artists, McCann brings them all to life. Do they connect at random, or are they meant to find each others' paths that strange day? Each of them views the incredible act of the quixotic Petit as a symbol. Each, in turn, becomes part of McCann's tapestry of redemption. We go on, we do, in spite of all odds - the human condition is never more strikingly illustrated than in this novel.

His prose wondrous, his vision clear, McCann starts slowly, but leaves his readers breathless. I can't tell you how much I loved this book; it has stayed with me and and resurrected itself again and again in the month since I finished. As Gloria, one of the book's most sympathetic character says... ""Sometimes you've got to go up to a very high floor to see what the past has done to the present""...

"Mary O. Garm ""mairzydoats"" (Forest City, PA)","July 25, 2009",5.0,"On the morning of August 7, 1974, Philippe Petit strung a wire between the new, not entirely occupied, twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. He proceeded to step out onto the wire, a quarter of a mile above the pavement, and walk across, eight times, for a period of 45 minutes, while office workers, commuters, and police looked on in wonder, admiration, and consternation.

Colum McCann tells the story of this aerial crime, enriching it with the stories of ten people who saw or were affected by the aerialist's action that day, including an Irish-born ""street priest"" in the South Bronx and his brother; Petit's sentencing judge, his wife, and son; mother/daughter hookers; and computer programmers on the West Coast. The reader is treated to a series of narratives that could stand alone as short stories, but that are, in the end, interconnected on the day of Philippe Petit's performance.

The novel introduces a stunning variety of social and historical issues that played out in the decade of the 1970's. The breakdown of social class is seen in the coming together of a group of mothers, mourning the loss of their sons in the Vietnam War, while celebrating their lives. The effects of poverty and drug addiction on women and children are illustrated by the ""family business"" of prostitution. The power of interlinked computers and telecommunications was in its infancy and creating excitement among the programmers who were thinking and dreaming big. The Vietnam War, moving towards its close in 1974, divided friends and family in New York City and elsewhere. The World Trade Center towers, newly constructed and occupied, represent a beginning in this novel, rather than the iconic destruction and terror we associate with them today.

Reading this novel, I was struck by the vast changes in communication between 1974 and the present. The Manhattanites on the sidewalk looking up at Petit paused in their busy lives to try to figure out what was happening 110 stories above them. They could not check CNN or their smart phones, as we would do today. They couldn't go online when they got to work to learn about what they'd seen. Computer programmers on the West Coast, who heard rumors of Petit's stunt, hacked into the phone system and began calling pay phones in New York City, hoping someone would pick up and tell them what was happening. In the era of the 24-hour news cycle and the Internet, it is hard to imagine how slowly, just 35 years ago, a sensational story could develop.

Like a versatile boxer, he shows you plenty of moves -- short, choppy phrase-sentences pop-pop-pop, then the long, looping overhand, with plenty of ring-dancing in-between. However, it may be the ring-dancing that wears me out. Like the Washington Post reviewer, I find the backstories of almost all the characters besides Corrigan & brother to go on too long. It seemed that McCann was having to find his characters via free writing, but his editor didn't step in to tell him the reader wouldn't require as much. Just get the story going. And what of the story? Some segments, such as Fernando's photographing, analyzing, and deifying subway art and artists, are almost plotless. It's a novel-length workout on the premises of Baudelaire's correspondences. In the end, you get the same message that the great, gray bard gave to us in 'Leaves of Grass.' No one story holds up to scrutiny here. If the reader knows nothing of these urban realities or the Cheever-Updyke looks into the interior world of a Yale-educated, New York City judge, then fine. The novel illuminates. In the end, though, for experienced literary readers, the gold that's flecked throughout the book ends up not quite measuring a troy ounce. Still, you read from fleck to fleck and hope to find those pages when they form a seam, no matter how small. It must be tricky to write such a novel based around real events. Who hasn't seen 'Man on a Wire?' No writerly description of that event's inside, which McCann gamely attempts, can take the place of what a viewer reaps ten times over when watching that documentary. At this point, having now won the Man Booker 2013 for 'Transatlantic,' a novel that garnered more poor reviews, at least stateside, than 'Spin' did, McCann would do well to consider some new structural concepts. Perhaps go deeper within a limited number of characters. Can he do it, is the question. Doctorow did so after 'Ragtime,' still the big daddy in this type of novel. Indeed, reading 'Spin,' with all the summery warm wind blowing through it, has set me up for a re-read (and re-evaluation) of Doctorow's big seller. Maybe, back then, I was looking for the things that many of McCann's fans are finding now in 'Spin.' [Proviso in next paragraph]

I have to confess I was living in New York shortly after Petit's walk and worked in experimental theater while living in the quite dangerous Lower East Side. McCann elevates New York's grit -- especially the Bronx at that time -- in a way that comes close to offending. Corrigan's bruises and cuts from being mugged over and over (or basically so) run off of his hyper-spiritualized duck wings in ways that a few of my friends (who ended up leaving New York) could speak to. After two years I left without incident. But they occurred all around me. I'd never seen a murder victim until I lived in the LES. It isn't pretty and the image doesn't float off to join a celestial piece of lacework floating in the rosy mist of times-recollected. It's more Weegie than Whitman.",0.8214285714285714,objective review

Renee S. Hack,"May 5, 2014",4.0,"The description of the wire walker was lyrical, precise and a delight. The grittier parts of the novel, because they are written so vividly, are sometimes hard to read, but viscerally ""true"". The author's structure - seemingly disparate, but actually nicely linked, took awhile to get for me, but works well by weaving a broad tapestry. This author is new for me, and I would read more of his work now that I have read this one.",1.0,objective review

Amazon Customer,"April 28, 2014",3.0,"We discussed this in my book club and the consensus was mixed. Although most of us appreciated the post-modernism structure, it left some of us with a sense that there was a lack of cohesion. Characters were integrated sporadically. It reminded me of the movie ""Crash,"" in some ways. There's always a subculture in society, and there are always outliers, but that doesn't always make for a great novel.",1.0,objective review
"HalleysComet (San Francisco, CA United States)","November 19, 2014",5.0,"A fabulous read. I couldn't put it down. And so poetically written. I found myself re-reading sentences again and again they were so beautifully written. Warning, though, the plot sort of conks out at the end....nevertheless, it's a fabulous book whose characters stayed with me long after I put the book to rest. Highly recommend it.",1.0,objective review
"Molly Rich ""moonface"" (grand island, NY USA)","April 26, 2014",2.0,"It received a low rating; 1 star would have been ""I couldn't finish it"". This is a book whose theme is the tenuous relationships people have, people who might merely be watching the same event, for instance. If that was built on strong and vivid characterization, it would work. This book, however, has some good, some bad, portrayals, only one character's dialogue that rings true, and a disappointingly weak Irish dialogue, which I had looked forward to, the kind that puts the accent in your mind so clearly. Not there.",1.0,objective review

"Helen Bonner, better books ""hbonner""","April 13, 2014",5.0,"Without falling. As one who sometimes despairs of how the world is going, I loved this brilliant and big-hearted novel, this microcosm of the world. At times, I had to stop reading and literally hold it against my heart. Without sentimentality, McCann let me open up to all the life-force, energy and self-determination of the characters he holds in his loving hands. From a gentle Irish Jesus who tends to a community of boisterous prostitutes, to a group of grieving gold-star mothers, black & white, rich and poor, to judges who just about give up on justice. His characters reach for life any way they can, with a gun in an alley, a spray can on a subway, a saucy stroll for sex, and those who try to control them with a gavel or a gun, good luck. In McCann's N.Y.City, there is despair, joy, death and new life, as thousands, like all of us, seek love, recognition, power and control in a world so seemingly out of control all they can do is spin with it. As bad as it is at times, ""ya just gotta love it.""",0.875,objective review

Patricia Stimpson,"April 2, 2014",4.0,"This could only have been written by an Irish writer. He is a wonderful writer and the book 'goes down easy'. But the lives he has us look at up close are tortured and unhappy and unlucky. I was depressed the whole time I was reading it. In true Irish form I started wondering if all lives are this unhappy underneath. And if the author says 'But I gave it a happy ending!', I have to say that's an ending that only an Irishman would call happy. It is beautifully written and worth reading.",1.0,objective review
