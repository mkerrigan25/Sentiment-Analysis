This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I was mesmerized by this book. As each of the stories weaves in and out of the other, all the time revealing more intimate details,
I became caught up in the precarious positions of each character. The urgent need to find balance in their lives - to understand. One of the best books I have ever experienced.
