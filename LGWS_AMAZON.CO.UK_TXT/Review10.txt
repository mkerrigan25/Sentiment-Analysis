This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
This is an interesting book based (very loosely) on an actual event ie a man walking a wire between the twin towers when they were newly built. However the story isn't really about this event but about the people who were affected by it. The cast of characters are very varied and not always expecially appealing. There are some very poignant moments and it does come to a more satisafactory end than I had imagined it might with quite a few twists and unexpected turns along the way. Worth a read but probably not a good holiday read as too thought provoking for that.
