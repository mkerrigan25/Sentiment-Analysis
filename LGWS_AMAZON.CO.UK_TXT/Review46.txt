Some great writing - scenes delineated with arresting and succinct imagery. Plain to see why Colum McCann is so highly rated.
But I couldn't shake the saccharin taste at the back of my brain - the characters are just that bit too close to formula, a bit too convenient and neatly packaged.
I wanted this to be a knockout as I like the guy, he's a Stoke City fan (pretty sure I read that somewhere) which obviously shows character, and seems a genuine good guy. But too much marmalade for me, not enough bite
