This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
We read this book for book club. While I enjoyed it I found it very heavy reading and would have given up had it not been a book club book. I thought the idea of writing about different people and linking them up was very clever and ambitious but somehow it did not work for me as I felt the author had intended. I would be interested to read more about the tightrope walker as I thought he was the most interesting character in the book.
