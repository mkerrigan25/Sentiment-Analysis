This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
This was the first book I had read by this author and what a discovery. I am now getting through all of his books and have yet to be disappointed . The writing is superb - very insightful and the linking of the stories well paced . Its a story of different lives around a momentous event. Its not suitable for people who maybe have a short attention span or want a lightweight holiday read as it requires attention and engagement. Can recommend to anyone interested in the art of literature.
