This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I read this book a year or so ago and had forgotten about it until I noticed it picked up a big Irish literary prize the other day. I found it very uninspiring and couldn't empathise with any of the characters and the ending felt as cliched as a movie you want to fast-forward to reach the credits. Takes all sorts, I suppose, but for me it's nowhere near the expectations raised by the hype.
