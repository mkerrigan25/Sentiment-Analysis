This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
Let the Great World Spin begins as a book of short stories relating to the events of a day in 1974... only it seems to unravel as a novel where the event itself is the protaganist... fantastic read, thoroughly recommended! oh, and it came on time and in great condition!
