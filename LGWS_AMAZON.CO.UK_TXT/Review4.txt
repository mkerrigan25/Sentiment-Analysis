 A very American book that takes you into the psyche, 5 Jan 2012

This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
Americans talk about 'post-9/11 books' and this one feels as though it falls into that category. I was initially unconvinced by its style of leaping from unconnected New York person to unconnected New York person. Of course they end up being linked in all sorts of ways that I found partially delightful and partially contrived. This book creeps under the psyche of the city, and most of the characters are slowly but beautifully drawn. I ended up being compelled by the stories, and bought it for others. My partner, who had listened to me complaining that I didn't like it at the start, refused to read it because of this, despite my attempts to rescind my negativity. A real shame. This is a book that grows on you, and actually, it is excellent.
