This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
Let the Great World Spin is a great read, the author manages to tie up all the various threads in each of the storylines without making the novel seem forced or contrived. The characters all carried their own burdens and the life's of the rich, poor and tragic are well drawn without being sentimental. The author does not try to deliberately pull on the readers heart-strings or push some kind of agenda (which given the characters and setting would be very easy to do) but instead lets the lives' and the stories play out and the characters fall where they fall.

Overall while it's not a novel that I would read again, it was very enjoyable and I would read more of this authors work.
