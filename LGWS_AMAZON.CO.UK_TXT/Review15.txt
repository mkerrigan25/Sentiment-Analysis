This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
A new version of the old theme of total strangers' lives gradually touching and intertwining, this time set in New York City in 1974.... The descriptions of the tightrope artist dancing blithely on the wire between the twin towers were perhaps the most interesting, letting the reader see not so much the motivation for attempting this amazing feat of daring-do, but his mental preparations, drawing into himself. In fact, McCann lets us look into the lives and thoughts of an array of extreme characters -- a bunch of Black hookers, an Irish semi-saint, a group of grieving mothers and their ways of coping with the loss of their sons in Vietnam -- in an almost always convincing way. I can't really say why I gave the book 4 stars rather than 5--it was a great read, but perhaps because I wasn't totally absorbed into the characters and plot, but more sat on the edge looking in: for example, I could read and understand the terrible grief of the sorrowing mothers but couldn't really feel it.
