The characters didn't really seem convincing, and the flow of the story was very disjointed. The setting felt almost artificial - it really didn't add anything to the story at all, and I struggled to discipline myself to read to the end. Just didn't hold my onterest, and I'm afraid I didn't enjoy it.
