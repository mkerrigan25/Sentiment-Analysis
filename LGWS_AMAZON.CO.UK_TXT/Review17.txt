This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I admired the literary, accessible use of language, the clever links between characters, the brilliant plot and McCann's fantastic ability to inspire a real sense of awe and compassion. The way in which a real historic event combines with everyday lives is remarkably well handled. The story unfolds in a multi-layered, very satisfying way and parallels with future events to add a further dimension. I had to stop reading the chapter about the actual high wire performance as I was on an aeroplane at the time, well above the highest buildings of New York and it all became a little terrifying! Elements of the ending were perhaps less than plausible but otherwise this is a brilliant book, hugely enjoyable and one I would consider as one of the best I've read in two years or more.
