This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
A series of stories about the intertwined lives of New Yorkers, this book captures the essence of the city. The act that knits these lives together is a high wire walk between the twin towers, yet this momentous feat seemed strangely underplayed. A struggling Irish monk who falls in love, a group of grieving mothers, a huddle of New York prostitutes - the characters seemed predictable and one of the book's central themes - of loss and longing - only left a fleeting impression. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't read it again.
