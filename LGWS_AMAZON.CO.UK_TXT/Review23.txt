This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
This is a book of interweaving tales of many people whose lives' seem to change around the instance of Phillipe Petits tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in 1974. The book is written in the style of 1974 even though it was written in 2009. Its not a style I like - some of the less pretentious tales are good with likeable/sympathetic characters such as the priest and his hookers but the rich/arty characters turned me off. Id say it was a book for a certain type of person and I hope they enjoy it because it passed me by.
