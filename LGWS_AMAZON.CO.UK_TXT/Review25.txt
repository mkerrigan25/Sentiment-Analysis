This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)\
Despite some exquisite moments there is a nagging sense that something doesn't quite convince. We are introduced to characters like the emotionally brittle and insecure Claire, a Park Avenue resident who has lost her son in Vietnam. Her husband, a judge, veers close to stereotype. An artist called Lara is central to one of the main events of the book, but she feels strangely insubstantial. There are coincidences and strange connections, and at least one credibility-stretching relationship. There is also a surprising lack of real warmth in a novel that seems concerned with the nature of love and family. McCann is perhaps too sensitive when it comes to the mechanics of writing a book, and he moves his characters with all the ruthlessness of a chess master. The book itself appears to be too knowing and aware of its own artifice, and when McCann mentions "The intrusion of time and history. The collision point of stories", his motive become clear, and it all becomes very self-conscious.\
\
At one point we're given the almost obligatory mystical vision of a wild animal in an urban landscape. The car crash as an event with narrative repercussions is also a familiar device. When we finally move to the novel's final grand ontological statement, McCann manages the feat of saying something and nothing at the same time. It all feels perilously close to cosy Saturday supplement philosophising, and we're left with a book which is easy to admire, but not so easy to like.\
