This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
The books centres around a series of characers and their lives at the time Phillipe Petit did his tightrope walk between the twin towers in 74. I liked the gritty descriptions of NY in the 70's which reminds us it wasn't always the way it is today. I did struggle to understand the point of the piece about Fernando the 13yr old photographer. If this section had been left out if would have made no difference whatsoever, in fact it might have improved things. It was "well written" as so many others have described it but parts of the book rambled on for far longer than necessary & I didn't like the ending at all. Overall I enjoyed it but its not a book I would pick up and read again. I think the hype surrounding this book have made it appear a lot better than it actually is.
