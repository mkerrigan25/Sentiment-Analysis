This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
This is a very well written book; and that's where it all ends. The novel consists of a series of short linking stories, but the stories are fairly uninteresting. The book is too earnset, vain and conceited. Yes, it is written beautifully, but it is dull. There is alot of critical acclaim on the cover, but the fact is that beautiful writing cannot hide the lack of creativity in storytelling.
