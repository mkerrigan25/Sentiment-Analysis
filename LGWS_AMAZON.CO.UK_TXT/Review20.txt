This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I can't recommend this novel highly enough. McCann's prose is near perfect, lyrical and beautiful. He weaves the lives of a dozen or so brilliantly realised characters together using the device of their shared experience of witnessing Philippe Petit's high wire walk between the twin towers of the WTC in 1974. Each character has a distinct and utterly convincing voice and a captavating story or point of view to share. McCann captures a real sense of time and place. This is just a brilliant piece of work from a great author.
