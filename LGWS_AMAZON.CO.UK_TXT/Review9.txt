This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I had to read this book for book club, but like many of the reviewers who gave 1 or 2 stars, I disliked the experience. I did not connect with any of the characters and thought them to be flat and uninteresting. What the book did give me was the desire to read more abvout the tight rope walker - the only interesting person in the whole book! Get this book from the libraty and save your money.
