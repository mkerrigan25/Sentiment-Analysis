This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
The whole book is well written but the key focus of the book is to tell the tales of different characters and I found this massively influenced how much I enjoyed, or not, the particular section. for example, I found the character of Corrigan, a radical Irish monk, not only unbelievable but unsympathetic, whilst I got really involved with the tales of Claire and Gloria. The overall character in the book is, in my view, New York itself and I really enjoyed that part.

I would certainly read more of this author's work.
