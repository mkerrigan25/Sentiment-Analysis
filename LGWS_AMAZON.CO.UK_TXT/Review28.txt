This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
McCann paints a wonderfully vivid New York in 1974 with a cast of hugely diverse characters. Not all of them convince, I have to say. Funnily enough for me it's the Irish ones who don't seem quite right. On the other hand the conflation of some of the New Yorkers is breathtakingly good, in particular the group of mothers with the common bond. Overall though it works very well, he writes with fine style and it's a great read.
