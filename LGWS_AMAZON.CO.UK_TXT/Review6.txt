This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
This was a strange read.At times I found it engrossing,moving.heart rending,and a wonderful piece of writing.At times I found it confusing not very clear exactly what was happening,and not very clear about exactly what the connection between the main theme and the sub-plots.
I thought some of the characterisation was very good particularly Tillie and Gloria.It gave a very good perspective on the character of New York,and also the life and tribulations of being a hooker.Perhaps I missed something.but somehow I expected there to be some connections between the story and 9/11.
I would recommend the book as at the end comes together surprisingly well,as I suppose this is a very positive attitude of the book that even in the last 70 odd pages you cannot connceive quite how the story is going to finish.
Good read overall.
