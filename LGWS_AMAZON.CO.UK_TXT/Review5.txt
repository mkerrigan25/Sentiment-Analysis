This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
Having been superficially attracted to this book via the 'Man on Wire' cover (itself a magnificent documentary film), it became clear that the focus of the book was much wider than the high-wire exploits of Monsieur Petit. In fact, I consider this one of the outstanding 'New York novels', along with Paul Auster's sublime New York Trilogy and Don DeLillo's epic Underworld.

McCann develops a number of utterly believable characters (priests, prostitutes, etc) and paints a very convincing picture of modern day New York City, with its attendant tragedy and pathos. A must read.
