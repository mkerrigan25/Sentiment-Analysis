This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
For a number of years I have been particularly impressed by the work of Colum McCann but for me this is his greatest achievement so far.Set against the background of Phippe Petit's amazing tightrope walk between the Twin Towers in 1974,the novel focusses on the lives of various New Yorkers who are all in some slight way connected with the Frenchman's acrobatic feat and presents to the reader in highly poetic,moving and yet humorous language their sorrows and aspirations often linked to the political and social upheavals of seventies America(the Viet Nam War,the dispossession of Blacks)which make each of the characters credible and involving.Essentially the book tells the story of New York at a particular moment in its history evoking memories of Joyce's Dubliners and Dublin's Berlin Alexanderplatz.
