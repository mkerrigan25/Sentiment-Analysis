This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
One of the best books I've read in years: engaging storytelling, the strands move this way and that, intertwining and separating again like seaweed in the current, but firmly rooted in the rich back-ground of New York in the 70s. Although some characters are based on stereotypes, somehow they all come to life, so that on the one hand you experience a sense of loss when you've read the last page, but on the other hand you feel enriched for having "met" them.
