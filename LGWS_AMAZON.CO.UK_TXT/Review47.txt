This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I once resolved never to be influenced by the plaudits of other writers when buying books. On this occasion I succumbed to the blurbs. Big mistake! The author of this book doesn't seem to be able to make up his mind what he wants to write about. The book begins with the famous tightrope walk between the twin towers. (The tightrope walker makes his appearance on several other occasions throughout the book - for the life of me I can't think why) Next we meet two Irish brothers one of whom joins some kind of religious order which has as its aim to aid the hookers and the needy. From there the book grinds tediously on to its unsatisfactory and inconclusive end.
