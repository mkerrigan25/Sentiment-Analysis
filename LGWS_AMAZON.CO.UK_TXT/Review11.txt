This review is from: Let the Great World Spin (Paperback)
I really found it hard to connect with this book and its interwoven web of characters.I cant identify a single thing i didint like but just felt it didint gel and certainly didint grab me I only finished it as it was a book club choice.I never got a real understanding of any of the characters and felt there was too many to be fully formed and explored

I personally wouldnt recommend this book but am sure that there are many who will enjoy it - it was just not for me
