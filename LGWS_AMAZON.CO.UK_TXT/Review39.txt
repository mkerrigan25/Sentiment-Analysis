This is a set of short stories set in New York, mainly in the 1970s. The main characters appear in more than one story, but the event that the links them is Philip Petit's tightrope walk between the twin towers in 1974.

There is much to admire in this book. It is very cleverly done and most of the characters are memorably and sympathetically drawn,,particularly the three bereaved mothers, Claire, Tillie and Gloria. However, I have an issue with the format. It doesn't have the narrative thrust of a novel and yet not all the stories stand alone. Some of them would seem quite mediocre if read out of context.

Unlike some reviewers, I liked the ending. True, it tied everything up a bit too neatly but I was happy to find out what had happened in later years. Some of it was quite surprising but made perfect sense.
